have a damn party! call morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. i'd like to show that fuckin' karl to the guys. they'd get a kick out of that. don't you know they would.
what, you think claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
all right.  kawakita, cover the rear.
my recommendation: do me. don't take the chance that i'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. ghost me, riddick. would if i were you.
hi, marty!
your ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
and he mailed it to hardy--
i wouldn't worry about schulz. i'd worry about sefton. remember me? i'm the stoolie.
not even for lunch?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
i'll make it up to you this summer. i promise.
hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. no cameras, the doj doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. you know the best place to hide a leaf?
i told ya he'd be pissed.
it's not packed with explosives, is it?
you want him dead too.
what i'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. and this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
so you're goin' to the gophers on sunday?
look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, i mean real combat.
can i write down my address and phone number for you?
i don't know. there's a small community of us. we have a place they don't know about. we're happy. we'll keep trying to figure out a way. come stay with us. join the struggle.
or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
this is state-of-the-art firepower.
order!
and, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
salvy, would i steer you wrong? let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
how about some candy floss?
what owners, harold? we don't <u>own</u> anything. it's a transitory world. we come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
...and abby. maybe. but as far as i'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
is there something going on between us?
but it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the squire and his wife --
you got some nerve.
tv repair?
yeah, sure, i guess...
perrier? san pellegrino?
what'd she say?
how many you turning out?
you don't believe in god anymore.
the people in new hampshire.
thank you for everything.
what did he say?
her prints belong to stephanie field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
call it in i guess.  why?
schumann. we're gonna go pick him up tonight.
yeah, look at me.
do you?  really?
now you've done it. you've given me nervous indigestion.  anything else bothering you, boys?
i'm sorry, kelly.  i'm sorry it had to happen like this.  she was losing it...
oh, look. another day in paradise with julie-your-tour-director...miss psychotic episode.
oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
what do you want?
divorced me. it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. it almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
no sir. i'm a veteran.
damn, big bro.  you swung that like sammy sosa.
then don't you realize the bomb gives us peace not war?  and, if that's the case, i ask you again: why do they want disarmament?
what do you want for free?
your majesty!
mr. saavik, all stop.
the 'puzzlement' i sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, captain.
that is your dream, not mine. my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine.
can you open them?
sit down, tom.  have you heard about our friend and partner, mr. hyman roth?
what's wrong with it?
but your goal is so hard to reach. do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  we would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
i dunno, toby. we really have a long way to go. you still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
you look like handmade shit.
i want to do it.
okay now.  have flipper flip or something.
yes you are. a guy. guy. quite a guy. oh my. look at that--i rhymed.  yikes.  bikes!
i just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
but it's over.  isabella's baby was the key.  you saw her die and everything, right?
i heard.  tore your face right off!  bad news.  it obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
no. it was someone else.
waddaya gonna do now?
we got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge remington shotgun shells. three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  all of them reloading twice.
yes, alan.
smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
well, i haven't figured it out, exactly.
it doesn't make sense. these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
would you remember his name?
this is fuckin michael jordan, man! they should be screaming.
yeah...what was i talking about...?
we need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
okay -- well, thank you.  i don't know what it's for.  but thank you anyway.
i don't think she will. she's a slut, but i just don't think she's that mean. jasmine'll bring her around...
yeah.
what's your plan of attack?
shhh! i heard you the first time.
two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! he is better than that!
no shit.
i won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
yeah. i mean a little, you know.
you never got back to me.  ...i called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... kind of a professional welcome.
right?  buddy?
i guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  the anthropomorphic problem. good, norman.
i don't know, conor.  it's not natural.  maybe something has touched you.
home.
this whole week has gone sour. it isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  i want to go home.
just the missiles.
why not? they're my favorite.
iraqis.
no.the guy's dead.what more do you need?
may i be stupid enough to inquire why in hell the base commander of the 843d bomb wing did a thing like that ???
i have my reasons.
arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  i need arnold to help me win this war!
no, there's another point i want to iron out.
and if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, ellen brody here will be happy to answer them.
one set of muddy shoe prints.
you are so good to me.  will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
listen, lightsnack, you stay away from andy.  he's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
i'm not. it's just corny, but i'm not into it.
where did you get this power?
how are you?
what else?
michael? what ha...
here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
what is it?
...i mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. she's like still a kid, herself.
what's going to happen to jack and me?
what do you do?
yeah, i been waiting three years.
continue.
you didn't have that with you before.  prima non l'aveva con se.
no...
i'm sorry. i feel as if i know you. i'm john triplette... a friend of del reese... i was at the airport. i just wanted to introduce myself. i'm a great fan of hers. if there's anything you need, just give me a call. i'm at the sheraton south.
then you found the leopard --
yes, sir.
so?
that's not the worst part.
you did create me in your image, nathan. before you i was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. after you i became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. in a word, nathan, i became you. lila has reintroduced me to myself. and, incidentally, what i'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth. before when i killed, it was for food or in self-defense. now i will kill for revenge. revenge is an abstract concept, nathan. and i learned abstract thinking from you.
where's elvis?!
you know where everything is...  i'm late for my shift.
yes ma'am.
shit, i'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
he'll kill us.
fine.  good.
but you'd love for him to play at usc, like you did.
poor dumb suzie, she never had a chance.
every time you're on television i get mentioned. that looks bad. that looks bad.
... so i started tailing him.
well, those are the breaks.
come home, dean.
boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
um... can dad come this time?
boris karloff!?
i'm going to go powder my nose. 
mary lazarus, i get the feeling that you like discipline.  hard work.
you want me to spell it out? there's nothing here.
what did he say?
no way.
no...
you didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
uh-huh.
eli, john is a carpenter.  as well as being a fine policeman.
hello, young fellow.
don't name them.  just tell me if you know.
hiya, walter.
oh no! there is nothing! i have everything, you have given me everything i could possibly want. i am happy every hour of the day. i only wish there was something i could give to you.
lemme tell you something. you are the pestilence. i'm the exterminator.
but don't worry, i'm clean as a whistle. i only did s & m.  no blow jobs. no screwing.
nice performance back there. where'd you learn that, mike ditka sensitivity seminar?
now's when you tell me who you really are.
'scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
it wouldn't be like that.  i want to get you off the street.  you'll have a different kind of life. what's wrong with that?
you know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
the m.e.'s report stated that marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
...today's "to do" list includes a trip to the mall of america. we need outfits for the "physical fitness" number --
well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
you saved our lives. you did it!
five minutes.
are you going to see him?
of course not!
did you know that guy who disappeared? didn't he work at pierce & pierce, too? was he a friend of yours?
milo? i'm danny.
i remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
don't let victor push you into making a mistake --
what in god's name are you doing?
you liked it too.
did you ever see mr. marsh use cocaine?
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen.
don't i look like i'm listening?
zero body count.
beer yes, but no whiskey.
they're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  they'd be better off letting it move on.
you can.  you're full of ideas.  you just need to squeeze one out.
to the pan of the supplies boxes --
what can i get for you tonight.
dave...
i get it. i get it.
no,i get it, this is my <u>cavalier</u>.  this gents my italian knight.  take <u>this</u>...  for this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
put that back.
hand rolled.
and i'd like to introduce you to mr. gekko, and his lawyer, mr. salt.
you have any idea when your father died? eladio?
mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
is there something about flames? about flaming, that you --
i'm getting out now.
in that case, there's someone here i'd like to introduce to you. over there.
hi.
valets.  what d'ya mean valets.  what is he, then, the earl of fucking doncaster?
so, do you think it's too much if i wear these in the same day?
dear god...i don't know how to pray.
he must have.
to our brave guests.  few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  we are blessed to count ourselves among them.
"soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
the irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  murders in the rue morgue.  le fanu's green tea.  my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
come on, don't crap out on me now. we got two buddies out there!
a dive? you mean, into the water?
i want someone i know to take me in.
i told you, that's a secret.
what happened?
i'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
captain, i gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
welcome to ya. what's your name?
ed --
do you bite your thumb at us? sir.
leave us alone, ramona.
what's your relationship?
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. you thought they were your friends. why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
i counted to three, honey.
i wouldn't drop my gun.
i'm not goin' home tonight... i'm goin' somewhere else...  to a girlfriend's house.  but, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
are you a carpenter, mr. rieper? herbert shakes his head.
no.
she's a...
you were how long on this?
you'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
what is your proposal?
how d'you know we're "friends"?
he spoke to you?
how about you take your position?
mph rmph rm!!
halina?
no one comes here after dark.
shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
no sauntering down the aisle.  just make time.  let's just get there.
and now? i mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
tell what you see. write it well, sir, and make sure you get it right
forgive my blood haste, jimmy squarefoot, but i want no more surprises from couer de noir.
coffee's perked.
mickey?  call the state homicide bureau. don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
i thought you were the one in her business.
i don't recall.  memories of the war, perhaps.
mrs. kramer, do you love your child?
returned it? where? to the video shop, tommy? to the fucking video store? so every punter in edinburgh is jerking off to our video? god, tommy, i feel sick.
i kissed those girls.
jesse, god - what happened?
she okay?
they smashed the phone.  i've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
we will...we'll have a lot of time together, michael....
apollo, how would you rate this last british challenger, henry wilcoxson?
you're not from around here, are you?  where you from?
people watched the movies in their cars?
mr. mcfly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
yeah, mary-kay, i think i do. thanks a bunch for the advice.
this is entertainment you're making, toby. this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
why not? you're a good-looking girl. and i'm--- available.
what happened? somebody givin' you trouble?
i like sleep.
what's an a.i.
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing?
it's your money. you talk.
reed? ... sue?
i could swear i had a '63 chateau latour in here. you haven't seen it, have you?
don't know where she got "marie," but "samuels" figures. her boy friend's name is sam.  was she in disguise? or do you want to check the picture again?
don't be mad. that was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
but...
we did the decent thing.
i haven't done anything, norma.
now i'm privileged?!  why?  because i didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  because i didn't call home a cardboard box?  no, i never ever went to bed hungry and i'm proud of it, too.  whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
what's that?
and i love you too.
well now i'm saying we're moving out.  get off your ass.
industrial refuse.
i want my fucking money --
he should pay.
good morning. book, is it? you are the yankee they talk about?
what other case?
an angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
let's get some sleep. that's what we need, man. sleep.
you got it.
jump, timmy!  it's too late!
no.
hello.
fair enough. no pressure here, barton, because i respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. one, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
of course, sir.
likes me? he said i looked like a grasshopper.
yeah?
michael... michael myers.
i think i'm gonna be sitting up with her.
i never c-c-carry arms. i'm... a writer.
listen, ah... we're going to take the cadillac for a while. how'd that be?
i mean, cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. by comparison. how about you?
bobby didn't give you this?
this place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
wanna hear something funny?
absolutely.  you always wonder where your books end up.  why don't we use it?
welcome home.
buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  listen, kid, i can't pass this up -- she looks like marilyn monroe.
that would be futile, admiral. the probe would neutralize us easily.
none.
about an airport...before everything happened.  it's the same dream i always have -- the only one.  i'm a little kid in it.
of course, it was mighty writing. there is no one like marlowe
you're too good.  we're in this together.  fates intertwined.  cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
sorry, no.  i just got one.
when he was baby we called him "wa wa," a baby name, you know. you will find him a very good boy. his brother can be bad and so can his sister, but waski is a very good boy. and as you can see he's beautiful.
so...
you survived and now you shall continue the curse.
did you see my present for you?
and what did your team do...
hi!
you are indeed brave sir knight, but the fight is mine.
could we move a little faster?
i'm not in the mood.
what?
could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
don't be a hero...
ah, yes.
no, jabez -- your place is with your wife --
it's just such a slap in the face.
i never promised you anything.
you got to investigate. no question about it.
the ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
then i'm a rich man.
the railroad has no business in tennessee. therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee.
geez! you look great!
i know.
i'm glad you're so certain, alex. it makes us feel a whole lot better.
doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you.
why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
this luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
it's just a souvenir. they don't even make the caps anymore.
i'm working trains. selling.
if there was one nearby i'd probably ask him.
please let me go.
i don't care.
yeah. rogue. picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
i do it for love.
that horrible woman!
where is your mother?
is that supposed to be funny?
hot dog! just like an organ.
all right. give me a voucher for expenses.
unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
susie, i told you i didn't approve of that boyfriend.  he was too old for you.  you let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  i went out one day and old mrs. jensen next door saw susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
mr. so- my employer has made up his mind. he does not change it.
we'll take it.  you manage the building at the end of the alley?
i should have known... once i would have... i used to be wary... and today i watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and i damn myself for having let her...
fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. how long can a battle go on?
i'm massaging his heart. i saw it done once.
ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
where's my brother?
there sure is.
before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. the rest is history.
is there a reward in this?
thank you very much, clarence.
all right, get up on that bar and dance.
rex just had a massive coronary. in the middle of a business meeting. he's dead.
maybe it won't stay in.
but you didn't ask permission. you broke a trust. if you had asked, karen probably would have let you. i'm sure she would.
if i wanted him dead, you moron, i wouldn't have dumped him on earth.
hi. this is nikki. leaves a message. 
oh, like your life's any better?
i thought i might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
how was i to know, my darling?
why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
i guess that makes sense.
you know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
history? just "history?" it must have been a survey course then.
okay, well here's yours...  "who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? not this one! stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
our black friends?
it'll be more than that.
either you're a member of the club or you aren't, elton.  tell me what you know...
fuck you. i hate the jews at least as much as you do.
jacques!  johana!
how do they know?
look, john. something terribly important's happened. they're forming john doe clubs. we know of eight already and they say that there's going—
now just a minute!
did ya get the message, kid?
we never should have done this to him...
commodore, i beg you -- please do this ... for me.  as a wedding gift.
want a smoke?
you've had a better offer, eh?
what color hair will she have?
yes, she told me. do you have children, mr. creasy?
listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
do you trust me?
web's dead.
forgive me, please. what a gracious thought. we must do that.
the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
why are you whispering?
that's right. i don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, i don't give a shit okay... i just don't give a shit anymore.
you better get some sleep.
we've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  we need to abort.
you can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should i say, not taking care of it.
i don't do that.
all right -- where is she?
wanna hear a dirty joke?
what happened to number five?
steady... steady, boys. keep scanning...  i thought you people were reliable... where the hell is he!
i got him on the knee!
recover any bodies?
we stand behind all our work.
to a great weekend --
wow, you got thrown out? for dante?
why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
put your money where your mouth is, taber.
now...now, i'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  it's just... i was happy.  why get me involved? you told sen that you weren't satisfied with me.
she must really be something.  from a clinical point of view.
well, which one?
you'll never believe who's in there.
this is fun.
don't use my name!
there's a killer out there -- we know who he is. he could be stalking now.
where is he? he's supposed to be here.
c'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
no! look lawrence, i've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and i'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. it's going to be for alternative arts, but i need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
it's them.
david! you're hurting my feelings.
no....the asylum!
you're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
thank you.
i'm not interested in what you think.
i will.
i'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. they didn't let their presence be known until after mr. blonde went off. i'm not sayin' they weren't there, i'm sayin' they were there. but they didn't move in till mr. blonde became a madman. that's how i know we were set up. you can see that, can't you, mr. white?
so, i've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
i had to get up anyway.
that'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
why not tell us what you have heard? hmm?  how much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
would you? i'd feel so much better.
alfred and bruce are like family.
tell them pete.  tell them...
pull them back, d'artagnan.
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you. i thought that earlier in the diner. that's why i was looking at you. you work at borders, right?
mr. m.?
you have to follow me?
tell me something, stamp. tell me this one thing. how much is a nigger supposed to take?
is that you?
no. i have to be in there...  alone. maybe there's something for me if i know how he feels and thinks.
hey harry...harry!  you ever heard of rekall?
oh no, jam. i'm not falling for that twice.
but who is judd, a psychiatrist. it's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. but why should mrs. redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
come here -
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... we were a lot closer than evelyn realized.
special agent pendergast.  fbi. forgive me.  i guess i was snooping. what is this?
watching.
i'm listening.
you know how many demerits we're talking?
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
that's his lawyer.
y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass johnnie-come-latelies braggin' on our own midget! don't matter how stumpy! and that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
two days.
strange, major. there was a firefight. shooting in all directions.
hey, where are you?
what now, my love?
there's jenkins' wife. you don't see her on no picket line.
jim was my husband. i want to know who killed him.  i want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
there is no pocketbook here... on the floor probably. 
what's the matter with them?
lane oil...
an' resistin' arrest... at least that's what the police said.
get on the expressway.
 ...have it.  you have to...have to get it to m...to mcgruder.
mm. how, uh... how did he know that--
this isn't meant --
so is the woman.
sal, just do me a favor, leave jade alone.
no. laudanum.
... like prince charming.
so you may have been duped this whole time. killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
i think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
i'm sure it is.  it's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  more than likely he never even watched it.
it'll be fine.
it's just cause mine is finer. a little bleach'll fix that.
wait. don't.
oh, yah, i know that!
next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
i'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
you quit drinking?
i hope you have patience with me.  i do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, i will learn.
yeah, two things pete, that --
don't worry, milo. i'm here as a friend. or maybe a supplicant.
so, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? you like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
hal will have my head for this.
what does it mean here -- about my soul?
what did he say?
he said it was a gift.
i hope it wasn't something i did.
you saw west's body.
well, i'm one of your biggest supporters. i tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
her?
because he's guilty.
if i pick it up, we'll only get back together.
oh, indeed?  you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes!  they beg you to consider the future.  what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
i <u>live</u> for midnight, when i can tear another of those suckers off.  watcha got for me?
what do you mean?!
that's not for you to decide. everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  the police will want his description.  is this a picture of him?
yeah in the trunk of my squad.
i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in. periwinkle blue.
sure. all right. we'll have breakfast. i get up about one o'clock. tomorrow.
did she have a weapon in her hand?
christ. how many tunnels lead off the island?
good call.
i can see just fine.  for example: you're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
you can’t do this. you can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
this is what it means right here.
it was a surprise, mom.
roald dahl.
no... if he did, i don't remember him.  there were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
yes, sir.
they thought she'd be coming to me.
no man. blood is not a turn on. you sure let that frida off the hook. you weren't even going to take the sheets. if i didn't know better, i'd think you liked her.
we tested the new bomb.
no. flattering, but no.
no you look, mister! first, you don't go calling my men names. it's bad for morale. second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
those flowers are too high. won't be able to see her.  get a smaller bowl, will you?
we don't know if it's random. we haven't been able to connect the victims.
but i'm not. i'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
for christ sakes don't point it at me.  we want to get rachel out of there in one piece.  i'm waiting for the girl.  her mother wants to talk to her.
what, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
let's face it.  sooner or later we all die.
yeah?  wavin' a gun around?!
thank ye.
i haven't seen her in almost two years.
then we'll die.
loki! where did you come from?
i am the one who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
you're thinking about killing him. i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one.
up the trail.
"there is a justice higher than that of man. i will be judged by him."
i like your car.
oh . . . my . . .
no doubt about that one.
i'm tired, trinity.  i'm tired of this war, i'm tired of fighting. i'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  but most of all, i'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
i thought you lived in chicago?
give me a name, any name, just so i got somethin' to call you.
hell of a night.
-- where'd you go?
...this way.
how long do you stay up there before you go?
okay, but i'm worried about the next pms bout. it's gotten worse. i'm not myself during it. i get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and i have more facial and body hair.
use your imagination!  first thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
yes.
it's not?
whoo!
you go and put your things away.
unbelievable.
what?!  a light!  yes, i've got a light!
that's not this direction. it's back the other way.
we really must go, mr. president.
right.
yeah, we're getting martin.
it's clear you are, and it irks me.
is something wrong, my friend?
no -- no -- no -- no!
what about medical?
uh...the admitting nurse...
how's uncle sibeal?
you're not much with girls, are you?
margo, this is too dangerous.  you always think you can solve everything.  this time you don't have enough information.  the animal might behave in unexpected ways.  leave her here with me.  don't put her in danger.
do you know who did this?
no?
you didn't
make it dry.  baby doesn't like to be wet.  you're valiant, right?  the name's baby herman.
and that was only my first try.
no. why would i be?
here.  a transport plane is due at eleven.  once i put him on it, it's all over.
how?
what have you got?
i am very sorry.
i will offer that report.  well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
of course.
your aunt?
it says here that his name is bright eyes. you gave him that name yourself.
you hung out with bobby vomit. who would want him dead?
it isn't always this rough?
i didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
and that's what you were going to do in the valley?
these archives are restricted to members of the house of erebus.
get that camel out of the way!
well.  a couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid i went down there for newsweek. the beaches were nice.  and at nights -- they had a band -- i danced on the hotel patio.  of course i never saw what was really happening there. when the war broke out i had to go back. and i promised myself that this time... i wouldn't look away.
they're too tight.
something good?
rennie...
that was a pity...
hey!!
we are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. my romeo has let me down. i see disaster.
then keep your mouth shut.
oh, an tv a minute and already an attitude.
you first!
no.  i'm scared.
i'm in town for a short time.
reinforcements?  where??
he was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
marty, i don't know how to tell you how much i appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. so my mother comes in...
yeah. well, we can just --
at least i can explain that, mary. your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. i helped her get that room.
why should i?
janine melnitz, are you kidding?  do i have a vase?  i brought some of your clothes.  wear something intriguing.  i brought along some interesting possibilities.
what's wrong?
nuns... you hate nuns.
you're one fuckin' bastard, merle. you know that? you're one fucking bastard!
well, she was.
would you speak up, mrs. kramer? i couldn't hear you.
i'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
okay, we're listening. but i'm with katka on this one.
is marty here?
what about it?
through there for a bath.
blasé and epicene.
twenty minutes?
there was nothing he could do.  my husband left everything to me.  i prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  i felt these were my husband's private things.  i didn't... i didn't realize...
it isn't worth getting a heart attack over, lois.
so at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
well, i wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. once we get the baby, god willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
do you keep any drugs in your house?
inside, vince.
i'm not using him as an excuse.
one-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
i just think it might be important to explore your feelings for lila.
oh yeah no i don't want to do that.
toby... who the fuck is toby? toby... toby... think... think... think...
you never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
what do i have to do for it?
we should talk alone.
do what, show you a good time?
a few years ago, i actually saw him do "dracula" live.  i thought he was much scarier in person.
that <u>is</u> incredible!  you know, i had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
finish what?
will we always leave it at this?
okay lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
why... why are you like this?
well, actually louis i have a friend coming by.
what's the matter? what happened?
sal? sal, it's me, nick.
you got me where you want me. there's no reason not...
i will, sir! i will!  i--i don't know how to thank you. i knew, if any man could help me--
keep june first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. and give warner our love.
she told me what you said, norman.
you sure? that doesn't sound --
do you know how to count?
i see what you're doing....
no - the ukulele.  and i sing.
what do i love?  i love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! the gardens at our house in freshwater - all my secret paths.
so, let me get this straight. you have the power to become invisible.
i was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
soon as i get that bracelet back i'm going to relax. wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--i got to win that fifty bucks.
great, i really need a shower.
okay.  great line at the end.
a cattle ranch?
...i will.
we got an unsub walking around with four feet?
let go o' me! i've got to get bruce out of jail! oh, walter, why did you have to do this to me?
our expenses?
you must be new in town.
... but it depends on what i'm doing to the music, dick ...
yes! yes, i say that to you, they were boys! boy friends of rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? do you want her to be unnatural? don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? it's the south, that's what it is, the south with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
where does that leave us?
for shelly, taking the money was a way to take from caesar.  he could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
you're not from around here, are you? where you from?
huh huh huh. i'm ready for love.
colonel. he had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
mookie, i always liked you.  not the smartest kid, but you're honest. don't make me dislike you.
you're telling me to dance.
—six—seven—eight—nine—
splendid!
that obvious, huh?
how the fuck did you know?
do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
you'd take no offense if we called you dela for short?
i guess you're right.
that must be him.
goodness is right.  if you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. i want you to be my partner on this, derek.  fifty-fifty.  that's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  in your pocket, free and clear.
who's in?
so what were they doing here?
shit.
no, no, no, the gal's right. we can't let the chronicle get the laugh on us! we've got to produce a john doe now.  amateur journalism, huh!  i'll show those guys.
maybe it's the tags that suck....
i thought there were too many forks on the table.
or he'll steal it like his brother. he's a mean little sonofabitch, edgar ... he had the irs audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
...now that's aggravating.
right.  so.  you must have an enormous record collection.
we're loose!
but where are you going?
david, grobleski & davis -  my dear rawlston - 
in the cars, too?!
you think my sister is there?
no.
i finally got through to sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the grand jury about haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the grand jury asked him the goddamn question.
finish what you started.  you haven't changed, chuck.  it's still you.
thank you very much.
nobody's gonna get you. now get inside.
what proposition?
where you goin'?
i'll tell you this.  after cleveland, i thought i was lucky to be alive.  but now, here, i just realized that you were the lucky one.
he has a very powerful ship. perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
thomas kent!
siwash, huh?
that's right. i said don't do it. did you listen to me? no. you wanted the money. so, i lent you twenty large. now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. what do you think that makes me look like on the street? i don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
these read as identical composition...  ... however, captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
the police...?
you're a u.s. citizen?
here they are again.  look at 'em.
doc, these are my friends. we're superheroes, and we need your help.
sir, i --
charlotte, who?
will this light do? don't artists need good light?
i'm having trouble scanning underground. there's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
two minutes til krieger shows.  thisíll have to be quicker than iíd like. certainly quicker than youíd like.
ahh-hem! now, rose, get off my lap. what are you doing, girl? are you crazy?
you cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, jack.
the opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
rowan...
stop talking...
listen to what i'm saying. the militia's arriving to quarantine the city. most of us are getting out while we still can.
you made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
how do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
get up, billy.
well, i've got a roomful of work for him to do. can't get scooter to do any of it.
why are you so determined to keep me alive?
hey, shut up.
and you think the movie business is any different?
hello, denby!
lyla's very nice.
excuse me madame? will there be anything else?
bitch!
mr. president, this is st...
sir, i have an opinion on this matter.
this looks familiar...
what, you think the guy should change his name?
what're we looking for?
we thought you was all broken up about toothpick charlie.
marry who?
well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
i'm hungry, i can't last any longer.
maybe the warning system's out.
hurry up, pop.
right.
jake.  you're gonna be all right, jake. you're gonna be fine.
doctor mccurdy, what was the cause of death?
i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice, relaying that information to you.
what the fuck are you talking about?
this is good.  this is real good. this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  they'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
and what are your answers? was it me? you think i set you up?
it's too short!  we need more monkeys!
uh-huh.  it was wonderful.
hush, claudia, hush now my dear -
and people close to him, who --
jesus christ, we're only going nine miles.  be there in two hours, tops!
he should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
actually, i've decided ...
how'd it go?
cancel? but it's her birthday -- i already ordered the cake --
you told a lie and got on a plane.
newt.  newt, wake up.
four...
margo, again...
whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
daddy! daddy! i love you! help me!
don't think about it too long.  you had enough?
you know...take the pictures?
oh. you know.
i don't see anything.
pity.
what's wrong? don't like flying?
why, so you can go after him?
i'm sorry, but you're not my type.
excuse me, i'm talking to you.
we try something out. there's someone i'm in business with named ruiz. i want you to accompany him on a drop.  just as scenery. ruiz has his boys. i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. as a deterrent.
what did you do?
patch me through to the bomb squad.
nobody else can.
dan.  and he's taking alice with him -- pretty good dive yvonne.  you've been practicing.
well, that's all. you will see. today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "hey, ma, it's no good being a single man. i'm tired-a running around." then he's gonna say, "hey, ma, wadda we need this old house? why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? a nice little apartment?"
so can i?
i think so. can you catch a plane?
they know you here--know your name.
is this what you mean, m'sieu laval?
mary clarence, don't be silly.  you're an example to us all.  you've taught us so much.  we're singing for the cardinals, and then -- who knows?  maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
are you okay?
look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
who gives a shit about aft?
dr. towler...
deceased.
maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
do max cherry and jackie brown know each other?
easy black boy.
murder.
what do you mean?
firehouse.
i blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how i know! now you're gonna say i didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
cameron.
where do you come from?
and last, but not least, adolph... you know who.
what the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> ext. hawthorne community center -- parking lot -- next </b> ed and choco exit the el camino just as domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. she grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
you have a question for helmuth, david?
how's this for a solution. we'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
i want to know you.
where's jake?
i made one rule for myself when this started and i realized i was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
sir, i would appreciate dr. mccoy absenting himself from this interview.
lucky nothing.  i had to empty my damn gun into him.
no'm.
your dissertation? what subject do you study?
what?
you're the biggest fibber.
i'm sorry. i can't do it.
you were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  i was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who i am. i'm not an architect, i'm a..
the chairs go, the lazyboy goes...
you're a beautiful girl. you don't want to ruin your looks. i've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
good on you, then, rafe mccawley.  we'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
why, no . . . don't be silly.
get out.
well, actually, sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to italian.
he said he'd sponsor me.
if i had to explain it you wouldn't understand.  just say we're brothers to the bone.
he's fragile, man!  he's very fragile!
but how am i to know the good side from the dark?
how can he be playing chess with you? you're not making any moves against him.
a little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
keystone what?
what am i looking at?
when did it all start?
was this him?
what kind of backup do we have?
eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. we have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from india. we have several hundred in the area.
who the fuck are you?
what are you doing?
you're asking for somebody else?
the best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. you do the right thing. you authorize me.  right there. whatever it costs.
it's our dog.  it belongs to us.
i'm working, bandit. besides, what's the matter? won't your new girl friend help you?
thank you.
-- and who's next on your list?
i like the way you talk.
this is my favourite place in the city.
your lips are soft when you kiss.
look at those eyes.
for your breath.  you could use it. squirt some in your mouth.
estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. reliant is closing.
you know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  how do you know i'm not going to try to rape you?
look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
tod might know.
that's funny. why is that?
what a pleasant surprise.  you're probably wondering...
some pretty bad people.
pleasure.
sheriff just radioed me. i'm gonna check out a possible lead. thought you might like to join me.
anyway, you remember harold?
you're so naive, mister.
things went badly in palermo?
uh, yes i, like, do... it's simple. you make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. you press the cd's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
yeah. banged up pretty bad.
kat! wake up!
commissioner, we both know the mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
we loved it.  we thought it was a masterpiece.  that's why we're here. we want to produce it on broadway.
i sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, i'm very sorry --
well, can you come back inside?
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them.
courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
...the digital conveyor.
i'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
soooo...dorsia is where jean wants to go...
yes, you always had a good sense of timing, henry.  when to give and when to take. how do you think mao, brezhnev will react?  do you think this is how they'll remember me, henry, after all the great things you and i did together? as some kind of ... of ... crooks?
did you hear a shot fired?
yes, gaston?
something about a plane with no pilot?
noooo...
what's a nanny do?
we can't leave the piano
how extremely clever. that is really most extraordinaire... allow me please to introduce myself. i am armand... and you are?
i suppose. but what if you want to live?
you make me weak.
well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
they told me i joined the army when i was seventeen. that's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since i was born 'cause my mom split.
-- gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. what do you think of that?
any history of epilepsy in your family?
what kind of symbol?
how do i know you'll keep your word?
of course not!  such a pity, that assassination.  in fact, i admired president kennedy.  a man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
keep going over these. i don't want anybody getting lost.
yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  and, frankly, i'm glad.  for steve's sake, i'm glad, not yours.  i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart.  steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
and no more demons. i told you they'd be gone.
arguing about books.
see?  you’re upsetting my customers. what do you want?
...george. i do.  my best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
no, it can't be, because he's a comic.
"the angel of flight 104!"  you're telling me you're the a...?
she's the captain, we should listen to --
these people are contemptible. they have no sense of dignity at all.
i'll take your suggestion under advisement, princess.  in the meanwhile --
hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
you are crazy!
he'll be contacting us again.
what if you don't make it?
i'm going to uphold that.
daddy! dad! dad what the hell is goin' on?
caesar, don't.

guess the capital of brazil --
this might take some time.
so grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
well, dottie, how come they're not here then, fuck-face?
you need to explain it.
what'd i say?
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town.
hardly. you have six bedrooms
well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  i'd better come along and show you the town.
uh, don't worry, i'm a very-  a very good driver.  so, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
it certainly isn't henry's fault hot lips houlihan doesn't like her name.
present tense, please. love her. whatever she is. i'm thinking of her now, fergus. will you think of her too?
you think about it?
i lost a bet.

you've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
what happened?
what do you mean?
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
holy...
"drove down the highway there was a big jam the family had died there inside their minivan there was a backup it went on for miles but as bad as it was it was gone after a while"  chorus here.  "you may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see to be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
you have his promise, then?
pan the group, will you. if you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
it's real, brandon. all of it, it's real.
god, i can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
we're going to think about it.
mr. ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  i don't really know him.
tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
well, if you want a coat, you got it. you know that. it's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  that's all i'm askin'. am i not entitled to that?
you shouldn't have.
you're losing it, damone.
now we get it down to two words--"next month."
why?
i love you.  now give me the line.
do you have t.p.? t.p. for my bunghole?
but others will know that you acted for the greater good.
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  it put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  we laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  when a bird called, we answered back. every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  we had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  i sang "oh promise me." can you imagine? where the hell did i ever learn the words to "oh promise me"?  looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b-36.  all the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  never stopped drinking blue soup.  blue soup all the time. we'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
i advise caution, captain; we can't withstand another attack.
this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  to me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
am i missing something here?
couldn't have said it better myself.
then get out!
all in the stomach, though.  your man might live.
you decided to help me. trust yourself. trust your own judgment. you can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
what do we do?
she's right. we should stick together.
what's the bastard really like?
he --
breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
thanks for a swell time.
kathy costello.  that's my maiden name.
i dove 315 feet!
is mae rose okay?
have a little snort?
of course.
thing is, dil, you're not a girl.
why?
it's strikes me now i never told her that.
guys, let's not panic.  isabella's safe.
amy, you remember the party invitations edward, gave you to mail?
gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  i want to know that you've heard and understand.  raise the mainsail.
scalene?
i'm not mad.  i am, but i'm not.  y'know?
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  please sit down.
like i said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
that's a sharp jacket.
did she always have nightmares?
bad mood? i'm standing with the cast of "the godfather."
it's alright.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
who?
we also own the franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  some plates, like the gone with the wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
well, well!  what is it?  we'll make you used to our ways, or adopt english ones.
new?
you're being served with a subpoena, mr. malloy.
i got good news, and i got bad news. the good news is you got your shot at the title. the bad news is...
what are the doctors saying?
it's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. it's pretty much discarded these days, except by the catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. it has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. it was purely the force of suggestion. the victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
you didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? the stuff i left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
can you get me on a flight thursday night?
i don't pimp that.  you talkin' about who i think you talkin' about, you mean rae. rae doole. sexy little split tail, like you say. i can't hook you up with that. i got two girls. one ain't in town, the other one pregnant. so... you on your own.
best over...
someone's playing hardball.  it's complicated.  can i ask a favor?
han! hurry! the fleet will be here any moment.
this you?
no, i don't.
come on, jane- it was brady's idea. i couldn't stop him.
yeah, ye-- i -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy carrut--
i didn't like it.
how do you feel?
sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
i'll be back as soon as i've got her far away and safe. we'll hunt this fiend down together.
we should be so lucky.
no, no, no. i'm not being cynical, i'm being honest.
no. the right skid's broken. if i try to set it down she'll crash. i have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  hey, carjack. we gotta hide the girl. give her your dress.
surprise?
heard you done the roof yourself.
leon - meet us at 63rd and madison. hair salon.  ludwig's.
no.
you can't look at them...
stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
now what?
this is the night you met clementine, joel. i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought, oh shit.
...what's your pleasure, buddy?
are you <u>real</u> mad?
this is the lapd. if anyone is back here i want you to come out and i want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
are you okay...?
you're a very beautiful girl.
you want us to move in here?
they lied.
well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  but get the kid back here. she wants to come back. that's the, uh, that's the main thing here. you want your kid, don't you? huh?
the bruce is not coming, william.
i never said that!
what choice!!?
helen -- let go.  you've got to let go.
you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
i'm leaving. goodbye!
do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
working with?
damn!  val, we can't get them.  never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  best goddamn bullet stop there is.  come back.
oh good.
what can you do with four daughters, i asked myself, a string quartet was all i could come up with. they hated me for making them learn.
i don't like no witnesses.
nah, skip that... i'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but i talked them into letting me walk you out.
he's a little unhappy.  i hope he wasn't a nuisance?
nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
thanks.
it's too late...
so, mr. kay?  what do you want to know?
give your father the benefit of the doubt.  talk to him.  let him see who you are.
you believe in the bible?
truck.
...i didn't recognize you without the smock. did i--damn--did i leave something at the shop?
evelda drumgo.
can i go when the holiday comes?
so you're really michael meyers' sister?
now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
i want to see the tapes.
i know, i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew? please, call me gale. you look awfully young to be a police officer.
gate three. it's boarding now.
perhaps i have a way to bring one here.
we could, if i'm not in jail.
perfect way to tie up a... 'knotty' problem?
according to bembridge scholars, inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing the book of the living.
how'd you know that, lowell?
there are cables overhead.  hang on.  it'll clear up.
well, i ain't like that no more, ned. i ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
right.  okay...  it's meant to be right?  this is it.
as long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
we need to make the trade tomorrow.
why, it's a man!  a man made out of tin!
are these your bags?
the second one just dies.  a 16 year old kid.
i didn't know you invented that smelting process.
did you give him a gift?
i want a pizza.
frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my father for years...so i hope you can explain what you mean.
that's what they call the repository.  every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
are you sure?
who's that?
i don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
i'm not a doctor.
ms.  mitchell.  so nice to finally meet you in person.
you welcome the sound. the sound is what lets you go. the sound is what frees you. you are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
pardon me?
how're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
none taken. hey, uh, does kayleigh miller still work here?
you invited her to our anniversary party? i didn't even invite my mother.
i thought it was funny.
well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down fifth avenue -- sort of break it in --
this vacuum don't work.  where's the restroom?
no shit. they had me by the balls. next thing i know i'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. not the street stuff mind you. they had us isolating special properties. the dark side, you know? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
eight scientists.  eight different fields of endeavor.  hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
stay open.  who knows?  lightning could strike.
we'll make time.  where's some paper.  we'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
does something else worry you?
you are so fucked up.
i told what's his name -- tom -- that i'd meet him.
deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
hey ronald.
nah, east village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
i want this one, daddy.
you refused to comply with a direct order.
-- a muncie girl! can you beat that!
yes, they are. you're out of shape.
i know that, dad, but --
hot damn, boy, i almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
come on, bruce. this is what i do for a living.
i didn't say you were scared.
you look much taller on television, mr. president.
what?
ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
well, i had my fun, i've drunk my fill and i tickled some good-lookin' fillies— i'm on borried time.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
who's this fuck?
this puts me in a peculiar hole.
we have to stop them from sending that message.
nothing, i was just wondering what you were doing.
hello again, neighbour. i didn’t intrude, did i?
it's the same image - kong!
it's not about him seeing you in it. it's how you feel. you'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. it's an inner thing.
because it's there.
because i didn't know... 
what do you think?
not if we do it my way.
don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. i spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  but it's not gonna happen this time.  we're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  if you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  and you better take it, cause i can make ya work for us without it.
the elevator broke.
nixon lives in saddle river, new york.
isn't that just my luck -- i get caught for everything.
donde esta? estoy perdido--[where are you? i'm lost--]
yeah.
i see.  slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
what?
mind if i use the bathroom?
you personally?
an apprentice for thirty years.  we've noticed your people's mental discipline. did that develop here?
slugs? no. 'less you talkin' about that new waitress down at sloan's! ha ha!
now then, mrs. kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
-- you got your microwave --
no, cuz, i rather weep.
do it!  shoot him!
wait. where is he?
what's the gig?
first lady...
please!  please!
oh no.
that i wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. at least you'll know i've been telling the truth.
not lately.  did you check messages?
sheila?
i ought to tell you something.
a treaty?  don't be ridiculous. what treaty is this?  who made it? who has been giving orders?
how grateful?
i don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldn't have. and yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. and that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
grudges?
billings?  no, no, no, no, no.  we need to go to mcgruder.
jesus christ, jerry.
what are you doing here?
i guess you'll be dismantling russian tanks soon.
you said "aloha" twice.
what's your favorite scary movie?
repeat the words again, and i run you through the body.
probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. henry's out there with them.
twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  it's all there.  wow.  a hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
no, jane.
they used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
my uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
not this again --
you said three minutes.
looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  maybe some kind of a rodent.
were you in love with him?
angelo, pay attention.  there's gonna be a test afterward.  lab is showing traces of toxins.  pcbs. heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
nope... never finished one yet.  i hate these things.
[the girl's. pinta's.]
you mean rashid?
yeah.  what?
if looks could kill, i'm dead...
when i told her i was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. it's the first time felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. she's dying to meet you, auggie.
is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
and if i consent?
the set doesn't look right!  it looks too... empty.  clutter it up.  put a skeleton in the corner.  and what's that thing over there?
you're crazy.
fine.
ma -- is she? --
the cops are comin'!
please.
came close this time and it scares you.
has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
is that the last thing you need? my your clever.
i don't know. something to do with the four-packs...  ...they're not bad.
right o'.
yes.  you see, the truth is, trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  but it's not here. it's in the matrix.
oh, you're sharp as a tack, elden.
no no.  don't cry at the beginning of the date.
come on, fran -- don't be like that. you just going to sit there and keep bawling?  you won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  look, i know you think i'm stalling you. but when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "pass the sugar -- and i want a divorce." it's not that easy.  anyway, this is the wrong time. the kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- i can't bring it up now.  this isn't like you, fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
can he save her?
how did you - ?
you'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  you used to eat it up.
did you wish to?
this is unusual. most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
clearly.
got a couple of kids, huh?
oh shit.
what have you done with the ring?
that big asshole nailed my windows.
hello.
what did you say?
here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
don't you?
can't he come out for one day?
isn't there something you can give him?  a pill or something?
wait'll you see the inside!
hey, man, is babe ruth in the lineup today?
... so am i, my boy - so am i.
we're losing the pattern...!
did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- one that she'd bought herself?
she asleep?
this is wrong...it's like we cheated...
is that all you want?
what about these two?
[not this way. call it a little favor, call it a little thing i'm going to do for you. i'm going to make chicago come alive for you. you'll owe me one.]
well, i'll have to take your word for it, mary beth. here's your money.
gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
everything!  prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- i can't stand it anymore -- i'd rather die!
no, because they're-they're laughing, so  i-i-i'd rather not. if you don't mind, i prefer-
is someone in the room with you?
you should do something about this lock.
can't you call it off... ?
whatever do you mean?
there's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
let me tell you how i want this to go.  i want you to look, and i want you to listen.
my wife's death. i used to work in insurance, we were well covered.
attorney of record for jabez stone. might i ask your name?
i'm fine.
that's just it. you can always get to me. there's this window in my heart and every time i leave it open, you climb in. unless i close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
what is that <i>thing</i>?
so far, they do. but, the quantity, it does not exist. you will have to re-evaluate your needs.
no.
what'd you say?
sir, i wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
peculiar?  you mean, like back then?
it's good medicine.
davidoffs. i get 'em in mexico. they're hard to find here. i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
really?  then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
nice set of conrads you have out there, mrs. schuyler. i was just glancing through this one.  what's michael tearing the paper about?
neither will i.
you got a name, cop?
i call. what you got?
i'd like you to have them.
look...  do you wanna fuck me?
...me?
i can try. is it comedy, or tragedy?
what's all that wood?
all right, jim.  you said i was running this show, right? you said no decisions without my approval, right?  well what the hell is this? what's going on, jim?
oh my god...  i thought it was a legitimate deduction, i swear to god. see... i need a piano for my work sometimes...
do you like that?
outstanding.
love...
what's slow?
what's so urgent?   you've got me worried.
monsieur blaine, i don't ask you to explain anything.
please, ryan.
the staff and guests! how many?
i'm not here. you haven't seen me.
it's actually kind of serious, dave. i'm afraid the president's not in very good shape.
mr. longfellow deeds?
general, would you mind making my excuses at our table? i'll be back in a few moments.
potentially.  this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
well, i'd ask guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
ellie, i've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
sire, the whole opera is finished. do you know how much work went into it?
10 million years earlier. humpbacks were heavily hunted by man. they have been extinct since the 21st century... it is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
looking to get out.
dr. macfarlane --
your man is the drummer, peter criss, right?
yes.
not until ben is back inside!
my life is gone. only life i was livin'. and i lost it.
i'm insulted. believe me, don juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
when are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! come on. let's get out of here.
it is today?
what's she like?
heather chandler is more popular than ever now.
hey.  the neighbors.
i figure telling that cop i'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. so no offense but thanks. see ya.
the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  and we got the match.
nothing out there but ocean.
not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
we've blown the computer!  elaine!  set course change!
know what this is?
yes.
seriously?
oh, jesus...call the police.
yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
i wanted this to be a date.
which one pulled the trigger?
joe officially owns no. 4, cheyenne walk, chelsea, london, england.  no small doing.
you're in the central corridor. it connects the personnel areas to engineering.
no. it's not enough... i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone.
how?
yeah.
i'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
you take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  stay put.
he's no steve young.
what the fuck do you want?
claudia, let's get married?
uh-uh-why?
oh, jesus!
eddie!  you scared the hell out of me!
no you don't.
i am michael simonovitch iranoff.
twenty-five wives!
it's just something i had.  you know
oh, great.
cheer up. now you can give some other guy a shot. make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
humpf -- so i was wrong this time. but by god, i wasn't wrong when i mailed you my diary. you obviously got it.
all right, jesus.
dude, our moms arrested terrance and phillip!
we're running, rorschach.  we've got no place to go.  we're hightailing it down to adrian's.
he is.
we thought we were escaping here. we thought we'd found an uninhabited island. christ! this place is a worse nightmare than anything i've seen yet!
hildy, darling!
who is it?
fucking hell...
don't worry about it, all right?
let's be creative.
what he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the sudan.
you remember the sounds they made?
missus...
yes, sir!  haaa!
hey, miles, i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
but you know he did it.
that's stretching it. you're not being asked to slay children or anything.
and some people need their medication tweaked.
who?... uncle pooch?...
herb wants to see me?
o'clock?
c'mon, i read your book. i talked to you. it's just something i know to be true.
it's cozy girl holding on... cozy girl and backtrack...
god, can you hear me!
many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. where has it been laid out?
that's all taken care of.
oh, dear, dear! his life! then i've only got an hour to dress. what are they wearing now?
hi. is dinner ready? i'm famished.
how are we gonna do this, nick?
i'm not mad. i'm in a fucking great mood. despite the fact that i'm trapped in a fat suit i can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
patrick? is that you?
all right -- i'll go out and find one.
i know. daddy's gonna get the rainman suite. vegas, baby. we're going to vegas!
he'll double what i pay you.
good.  there.  yes?
don't shoot, sir. i can deal with this.  ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. see, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. and it's not that i like you or anything, but i've kinda gotten used to having you around.
why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
you don't have to sound so emphatic.
i thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
it was fiction, of course.
six one.
what!?  what!?
time to wake up.  hey, kid, time to wake up.  rashid!  up and out. i have to work in here. the slumber party is over.
thank god. are you okay?
that's mighty brave of you, reverend.
stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. treat him right.
i'm dropping the case.
you want to stick around here, sailor? see if we can get some work?
katherina! i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i'm going to write another aria for you. something even more amazing for the second act. i have to get some water. her mother is lying on the stage.
detective williams here. yeah. tell him to go to sergeant milton. yeah, copy.  well, jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. very interesting. i know you must be curious to know more.  but. i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. one day. when it's all sewed up, i'll let you know all the details. right now, though. i can't.
buzz off.
san juan!  you must know my good friend pedro martinez hernandez hector elizondo.
how well do you know this place?
why did you do that?
he was not dead before. i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
i don't want that. i want to be with you.
maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
hey, this what they got you doing now?
okay, we'll order out.
i wanted to give it to you first.
have we got something for you. something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
no. no, wait a minute. we stopped at a porno store.
he keeps on acting like such an asshole!
miller.  thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  really didn't expect to lose him.
create a little drama?  start a new rumor?  what?
hah.  ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
la dai! la dai! get the fuck outta there!
should i?
well, well.  mrs. brigman.
hey, do you mind if i talk a little?  i feel like, i don't know, talking i guess.
there's something else i would like you to help me with.
yes.  my room is down here -- i'm not tired.  do you want to keep talking?
any demands yet?
i'm chewing.
he'll destroy us.
well, i just hope it was worth my while, mr...
-- super what?
you should not bother with that birdhouse.  if you're leaving tomorrow.
ok, whatever. let's go get your brother's truck. faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
a ticket home,
well, i guess you pick your poison.
come on, let loose!
how many of you are there?
ben...boys.  yeah, real slow, and i'd like to keep it that way.
thanks. see man?
what for?
go united states.  see nguyen. maybe teach economics.  buy cadillac.  watch "dynasty."
well.
john.  please.  listen to me --
... it's easy.  you go down.  you come up.  ... right, johana?
get us out of here...
well my cousin fred met this dame from back east.  she's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. and here's the kicker: she's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
not we, you. stay with your mother.
and i was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
george... do you hear me, george?
okay, "bro," this jig is up...  just get in the bottle. just slide right on in there.
don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
yeah. like you said, you know. i guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
you hypocrite.  do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
it'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
yes.  give me your news, zoe.
you're going to thank me for this. you know what the media's like. they love this kinda shit. if that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
yes.
yes.
you can't say that to the president... put back "president"... now let's hear how sounds.
are you guys all right?
i just...well, i had this cousin in delhi.  she was having problems, too. she, ah...
you all right now?
easy, mon.
thank you.
hi sweetie.
do you know...34 c?  32 c?
look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
look, my life is not so great, that i want it shown on television. and neither is yours.
then why are you here?
john: you go fetch ruby.  big ruby's my problem girl. she can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
miss me, dave?
do you walk home?
what was she like?
it got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. got fresh 22's on her. ain't my doin'. that's just how it came to me. don't worry. nobody gonna come lookin' for it. i got the pinks... got no problem.  ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
get the bang sticks.  we're going down.
i do apologize for this afternoon. i behaved like a silly girl. where shall we go?
not for me. i don't touch it no more.
do i know you?
i just want to say to tony -- don't take it personally.  the more i think about things, the more i see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
what?
meet point's up ahead!
no!
you can't turn him off.  he's the commissioner.
vodka martini.
do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig? he sent me a birthday card.  belated, but it's the thought, right? oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. but, then again you guys probably know him better than i do. in fact, i've only met the guy once. but now, now i have you. the next best thing. his partners. his "fix."
whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. we've got every right to salvage her.
i just don't excite you at all... i don't know what you want... i don't know what you like...
and i couldn't follow her.  god knows i tried.  one doesn't often get a second chance. i want to stop being haunted. you're my second chances, judy.
and that's why i want you to be on the pleasantville chamber of commerce.
david! where on earth have you been!?!
only to keep warm.  for illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
oh, nothing--only i wondered why you suspected him.
murdered...? how?
last night --
you some kind'a pervert?
let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
bet your ass you are. now i don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. you gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
i don't give a shit.
what do you think?
you're really one of us now, aren't you?
and don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with frederick bennet and charles rust at '21.
how'd your interview go?  i'm sure you charmed the hell out of sally.
listen. something's been bothering me about last night.
everybody!  crunch and goon and everybody!  i think they're going to kill you.
how come you're not wearing my shoes?
anything you say, officer.
baptism. you two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. well, i guess you're my cross to bear-
what?
ow, ow, fuckity-ow. bren, when do i get that spinal tap thing?
thanks.  want'a bite?  mcdonald's vegiroll.
what kind of information?
murdered?  why?
mr. holland?
now, listen. for god's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. go to your room and get back into bed.
--i know what i'm talking about. i'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  guess i'll be going.
were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called aids, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
by my count, i was your mother much upon these years, you are now a maid. thus then in brief: the valiant paris seeks you for his love.
great, thanks for the tip.
what kind of tent?
the loser ran off alone.  the winner followed those footprints toward guilder!
dr. gruber's not in.
well...
what brought you back?
forward motion, captain...!
what?
huh?  oh. they said i was crazy. said i wanted to run it like a grocery store.
sir, as the enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  it appeared to be the captain's yacht. five persons on board.
thank you.
hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
you should call your grandmother.
a "complimentary corsage."
such the flirt.
money?  man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  we was going to get high, and i was going to show this white boy how to make kool-aid.  that's all.
now, i'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
look at this finger here.
it's not enough.  for hospital bills.  for nicole.
i'm tired of playing overseas.  thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
well.  see.  that was a... reflex to see if it would...
you're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. you got no right to be here! theo yanks the trophy away from buzz.
farm boy. fill these with water --  --please.
i'm sure that's it. 
you remember me? upstairs...
that was rather.... disappointing.
you can't win 'em all.
you think that's really any of your business?
oh, yes.  the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
at 0821 we received a distress call from planet p, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
where have you been the last few weeks?
that's your problem, george bailey.
sure.  that's great, ray.  i think you should get down there right away and check it out.  let me know what happens.
yeah?
umm...can you come in for a minute?
bring your friends.... we're not his friends.
a fair number, ma.
i've never seen anything like it.
i'm sorry.
he's not drunk, he's crazy.
we got a problem?
i've tried to do well by you, jack. by both of us.
yeah, i hear you bagged martin weir for mr. lovejoy.
all quiet?
he's a barber.
it's okay.
don't worry about it. he's hard, but he's fair. you're lucky to be shipping out with him. he's one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach.
ex-girlfriend?
how come you keep askin'?
oh no, she's nothing like you.  she's a lot smarter than you.
look out!
it's me, peerless.
please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
why?
somebody must have seen it.
it's a nice place you got here. real comfortable. sweet little town, fair oaks. you like it here?
oh no. no, please.
chiang cho?
yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
i'm sorry about that.
maybe i do.  ...what a fuckin' mess, huh?  people can change brian.
what about me? aren't i a loose end?
out of...?
listen, i'm not--this isn't a joke here.
hello there. well, well! if it isn't the man about town!
i didn't realize i had to declare a major.
sure.  i've got a gas powered jeep.  i can drop her at the visitor's center before i make the boat with the others.
yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
no... a little. there's a lot of debate about it.
--f'chrissake, heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
tell mom, you know...
her father didn't leave her squat.  the kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
come on.  let's get a drink.
wow.  you wanna grab a bite?
what'll it be, auggie?
i look good, that's it. so what else do you do for these girls?
you came right to it, son of a bitch --
if it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
i want out of this marriage.
oh, yeah.  they gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  no expense account.  no place to live.
look out, you --
so. you and debi. gonna hit that shit again?
i thought it was you. it's the hair!
it's simple. you pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
nothing. still nothing.
you're still not listening! i'm not..
what?
let's go eat, i'm starved.
three cents.
i can be talked out of it. as a matter of fact, i'd like a dry martini myself.
you coming, or are you waiting for blackburn?
"you wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
you get hardy.
okay.  then we go this way.
ellen.
we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
larry, i'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
hi.
no, i don't.
what?
for chrissakes.  you gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
does this room look silly?
this'll do.
ganz and billy got my girl, rosalie.
i think about it everyday.  but, every time the phone rings... every single time, i still think it's her.
don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
uhura, any response from starfleet on our project genesis inquiries?
what's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
he owns it. you know?
your spidey senses tingling.
all i want... is to make it to sidnaw, and sit down for christmas dinner. watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part?  have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  i'm an actress!  it's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  everybody knows that...
oh!  oh, zeke!  help!  help me, zeke!  get me out of here!  help!
talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art i have not mastered.
the union don't run my house.  those anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
you must believe me.  you must come with me while there's still time.
apparently, yeah.  i was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
that's not my handwriting.
i'm off that case. he fired me.
why don't you use the phone downstairs?
i'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. i take care of myself, and i got some money socked away. you'd never have to work again, that's for sure. i'd treat you like a queen.
the author. thought you might be interested.
all right.
when a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  we're breeding them for submission.  soon they will be fully domesticated.
pony's coming here to the corner?!
i have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
brodski i'll talk slow so you can understand me. she's thawing. if we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
however they are, that's the deal. a buck a throw.  five thousand dollars.  split it half and half.
 there's nothing in here, sir.  they got away with it.
brodski! get to lab two. we have an emergency!
baby, you did fine.
no...no.
ann--
i could make her another cleopatra...
i didn't mean to let them do it... that santiago, he tricked me...
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos? that's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  careful of these tiles, they're slippery. valentino used to dance here.
you want a drink?
who's this fat man, then?
how are you fixed?
you don't like me?
i don't know.
where is she now?
you talk them into it?
this is inez. carmen. anita.
i've got a meeting in chinatown.
that's bright eyes. the one i was telling you about.
the families... want your ticket. turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  everybody goes home.
i just wanted to relieve your mind. your father's alive and all right.
ligature strangulation, just like his victims. a cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. should have cut it off.
that cat ain't mean. i feed him out of my own hand for six years. why don't he kill me? at night in the truck, i let him out of the cage. when i am falling asleep i hear him walking back and forth. i go to sleep. he don't hurt me.
yes. i went there to find the lost power source...
six. their plane went down right outside scranton.
hope you get to where you're going.
and, please, tonight, for once, i don't want anything bad talked about. let's enjoy our meal.
sure!
another? but that's too soon! tomorrow night? it's impossible! did he say a hundred?
gosh, no. lipstick? what next? mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
morning, officer.
what'd i do?
that's kazanski.
collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do i do if he smells the trap.
sue. your clothes. lose them.
he waited for you three hours!
hi.
i'm a-tryin', ma. honest i am.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
he's so tiny.
sure it is. i think tonight brady was ready to make a commitment.  but now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because i have to baby sit tonight.
that's too bad.
merry christmas, mr. campbell.
there's a dress code?
what the hell are you guys getting at?  i make horror films, that's what i do.  the studio came to me with 'stab'.  they came to me, check it out.
how did it go today?
no, i saw a guy shooting from over there.  he was behind that fence. what are you going to do about it?
maybe i do.
i'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you.  why don't we continue this on thursday.
i know how to do this!  i'm good at these games.  you never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
because i'd like to have dinner with you.
she didn't have to.  he could have climbed down from here.
give us a break...
this is barry.
it's part of the hydrogalvanic system. the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
we need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
what are you an idiot!
it is.  we know that.  and it's enough that we know.  just think of the girls.  they're still young.  we never see them.  i lost my parents.  i don't want them to lose theirs; i don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
certainly, ben.
outside!
whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
back to san francisco.
what... what are you doing?
no, no, we have to get out of here right now.
so what?  what could be important enough to put your hands on me?
the photo album. i get nostalgic around this time of year ...
naw.
it's all yours, heather. now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to go throw up.
three.
not working? this nose? this nose works day and night. this nose has never loafed an hour in its life. this nose ...  what?  impossible. this nose asleep while venison fills the air?  where is it, boy? tell me where it is and i forgive you everything.
wait a minute.  i want you to get out the car.  you're going to take the script over to paramount and deliver it to mr. de mille in person.
i gotta go.  we're on borrowed time.
great. that's great.
now what?
this isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
extremely unfortunate maneuver.
well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
that was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  you must try to talk about it, billy.
that's right.  i told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- miss olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
it'll be heaven!
now see here young man.
something's wrong. i know it.  i've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg.
yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
rebecca -- take these off.
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, i need to lay down. there's a cot back there.
he doesn't miss a trick, does he?
what's that?
her name's sandy ...
tomorrow night i dine with the emperor. one word from me and the post is his.
you have tranquilizers?
sometimes i control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
i can't follow you, gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? you being my servant? wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
i want our boy back.
sintag.
after that, i went out of fashion. i was no longer able to command the best projects, so i walked away.  why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
i walked.
how do you know? you been there?
check out the tent.
would that make me a heel?
i'm sorry.  look -- there's a gas storm on the valles marineris . . .
you think that's all we busted -- you should see...
no bad dreams.
what'd you say to him?
that doesn't make any difference. i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. they have a very special value for her.
and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
so, come on. you never saw us kiss like that?
she won't even know.
not at all, hank ... not at all. glad to help you.
norbert was just beginning practice. a real man would have sold her to a catfood company, i suppose.  as far as that goes, j. edgar hoover still lives with his mother.
can you feel that?
do you want me to do it?
yeah, and he's strangling me...
i thought he busted you a couple times.
did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
i'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
what the hell was that!  what did you think? did you think it was loaded!
i'm not saying it's your fault.
let's hear it.
yeah.
i'll call you.
you?  you think you're the only one?  i've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
you have not been fully trained. but you will learn.  and you will be good, i can feel that.  you have apt- itude.  this is why our friend is so concerned.
bartok ... have you ever been to paris?
please finish your story.
oh? have i seen it?
which means he's having nightmares again?
policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. look at me. gut in its fifties. balls in their six- ties. and feet in their eighties ..
soon as i'm back, i'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
aw, come, come, come --
sally doneghy, now who is that?
i'll see you soon.
rick... debbie is mine. she'll always be.
chauncey, i just wanted to wish you well. i know you'll be smashing.
"go get 'em, honey."
we're getting a little old for running.
i don't know what we've been waiting for!
not unless we're blind.
the prison of belle sur.
steven buggin' you?
i'd seen him in a coffin so many times, i expected him to jump out...
fine work, jon.
we know the briefcase was empty, man.  we know you kept the million bucks yourself.
you ought to write these stories down.
i noticed you were having some problems, blue five... i thought i'd help.
what?
we're all manipulated. from the moment we're born. the event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before i was even born.
i looked at them.  they're shrubs, small trees.  exquisite.  and fossilized, rock hard. he walks away to the nose of the plane.
i know.
i'm sure he's alright, bea. they'll find him somewhere.
i'm really rooting for this one.
what happened?
we leave the money and the watch on the table. and we cover it like this.  in full view. the germans will search high and low, i promise you, they'll never notice it.
well, there's nobody special!
why?
no shit.  since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
yes, i've seen you in something. that one about a king.
there's an empty taxi across the street.  if you're so anxious, take it.  he'll know the way to the police headquarters.
listen, joanna kramer's got a goddamn good life.  she's got a husband that loves her.  she's got a terrific kid.  she's got a wonderful home--
...did you make that up?
who says anybody's gonna be with us? i say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
in a little while...i'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
they tortured my husband.  made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
go to the northeast corner.  call a cab.  bring the pizza.  then there's a poem.  roses are red, violets are blue, if the pope goes to washington, i would, too.
 okay.  okay. 
how can you kill him like that?
say, bill...
but you always said things were so great at the academy... what happened?
you stand someplace else, man. you stand someplace else. this is our corner. you don't fucking own it!
what?
this is all my fault.
no.
i'm not a bloody teenager okay, i told you i can't do that shit.
trust me, jimmy, there's big money behind this.  not just big.  big.  like big business big.  big corporation big.  big government big.  our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  nothing but net.
you think so?
no -- they don't.
is there a difference?
colt peacemaker.
the door was opened, so i just came right in.
so we go to the bar.
nada. vague description, that's all. fine-tooth-combed speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
yeah, but he didn't see me.
yes, wasn't it?
a simple theological discussion.
i just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
i can't leave now.  don't ask me to explain!  i just can't!
he's right.  they'll smell that you're human.  stay here, watch our backs.
no, you're not model material.  anything else?
oh, them? well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
well...
i've never brought anyone down here before.
nice-looking kid.
this night is too beautiful to have again.
my firm'll represent you. free of charge.
ya nose is broke.

what about betelgeuse?
your majesty.
what we have to do is call the police.
maybe i like garbage.
just took a guess is all... you in or out on this deal?
what else you got?

by the way, i like the renoir.

i'd hate to get lost on that freeway...
okay, we gotta get over there.  can you borrow a dress from cecile or something--
sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
take a break veronica, sit down.
give me a break.  that guy's a wacko...
at some level, i don't understand your nervousness. have you decided to leave john?
well?
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
he claims?  powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? or some kind of nut case who --
radio said negative five.
and what you're wearing, that's great, too.

cold feet.
that's impossible. michael myers is an invalid.

christ, look at her. you'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  good evening, miss diamond.  you're late.
they'd put you in jail, eh? well, historically you'd be in very good company.  that's what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo. would you like to do a little raking?  work, i'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. on the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
oh leonard . . . when i sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole.
yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause i'm moving out to l.a.
he's going down.
that ring's so great. the green one.
but i don't have a conscience.  i'm a bloody thief.
my husband had been working on something he called, the project for the children.  are you aware of this?
i told you to cut down on the sugar.
what kind of trouble?  what kind of trouble agnes?
what's the gun for, general ripper?
he offended me with his terrible taste.
all this just to get the kid? what's so important about him?
jean luc, whatever you were... right now you're the man you've made yourself. he's someone else.
come on, terry, we got a ride!
one of the seven natural wonders of the world.
-- what advice? you never --
no.
i felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
this is the best score yet.
spock?
how is she?
hey, what's this? wearing papa's things? now that's cute. that's what i call real lovey-dovey. yessir.
someone to see you, dan'l!
eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
maybe i ain't.
come in, sheriff.
what was he saying?
my best friend got pregnant.
or her name?
what a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
you, you just need a new flint, general.
outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
you're implying that i planted a gun?
thanks walter.
patel?  ravidam patel?  how am i going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  where did you get this, from the morgue?
thank you so much.
was he a good detective?
but that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
shh. i'll tell you.
yeah? and just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
you okay?
-- uh... buzz, i'm sorry, i -- buzz, you gotta forgive me! i shouldn't a fired you, i didn't know what i was doing! i was a little funny in the head, i --
you know mom, it's okay to have male friends. besides, it's over with me and charlie.
then teach me how.
three years.  how long have we been in business?  three years.  does she get to meet your connection?  was she good enough?
never mind. i'm coming in to take care of business. how hot am i?
dr. frederick fronkonsteen.
i heard sir te lost something.  and now madame te's not feeling well...
...well, it didn't make him happy...
stay away from me...
i'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
director?
what the hell did this?
the police will not know that. they will want to investigate.
michael, i don't want to hear anymore...
here's ghengis kunt and the demilitarized zone. get it?  they're korean, so they're pretty hot.
he came in four minutes ago.
captain, how soon can we land?
you said there are advantages to being single. i want to know what the advantages are.
really?  but, maxine, can of worms! end of the world! illusory nature of existence!
who is?
yeah...
objection!  this is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
what made it grow?  do you know?
listen. i'm not like myers. he makes you feel like you belong. and -- that's good. it really is. i -- wish i could do something about this --  but i can't.  i can promise you only two things... one: i'll always look this good. two: i won't give up on you. ever.
hey, lady, i got faults, i know i'm not perfect but i don't get this at all, your attitude.  i saved your...
how exactly did you hear?
i know, i should not tolerate his impertinence.
it's just pearl harbor.  people are a little crazy, right n...
you picked that up on the scanner. we gotta move.
is that the way it was with you?
that isn't true.
the chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  by 18-hundred he was gone.  out of the navy.
what do you mean... what am i talking about?  do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  i am dying.  do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
the fax machines.
not on the same floor with valentino!
you know what the bloody time is!  it's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
i promise.
oh god. we. liz. we. we. killed a woman. we...
it was a harmless little prank. who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
what are you spying on?
i hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
it's freezing, isn't it?
oh, you two idiots! george, sit down and have dinner.
if you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
free --
this is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
you ort not to pull on yourself that away.
you're a little touchy about it.
the countess has come to our aid. the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. and i have been asked to oversee the ranch. for $300 a week. and as it turns out, the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
oh, no.
who ?
mr. o'higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin.  mister o'higgins, i wonder if i know your good father?
bourbon, little water, thank you.
if you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
hiding him where?
well, freud was right. so you think they came for the fag man, huh? and what do you base this upon?
not me.
at least!
he thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
well, i'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at brown & williamson, a former corporate officer there.
exactly how long has the bijou been closed?
i'm sorry but i think you better talk to someone else.
if only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
we did it.
... never complain, never explain, john ...
ah, what was that again, i still can't hear you?
you're telling me you feel guilty.
did you go hunting.
like what?
get out!
you're our optimist look at the bright side. if that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
most unusual. an unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. i find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
some fleet driver for bell just got cut up. just heard it on the radio.
on the plane.
go on, adam ...  i'm not asking you for anything -- i was never even going to tell you. but hell, i never thought i'd see you again, either.
give me ruben back...
'bout five minutes.
maybe you and brooke could come over to the town beach....
are you all right?
buy me out?...
well, news of buckley?
forgery and fraud?
then that's all you had to say.
can't you give it to me later?
yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
you're not baxter?
what's that, frank?
please, if you'd just listen...
you said it.
what do you mean i can't see him?
...then don't.
i don't know anyone who fits the description.
i almost forgot.  that pal of yours from the vice squad wants you to call him.
i think i got something.
why so few?
so you'll stay?
i have to go to the bathroom, cynthia.
we've only got honey.
hello, michael.  i've got something for you...not much...but...
my sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. i just copied her prescription. you don't need to pay anything... just take it. but if she gets worse, you give me a call. i wrote my number on the box.
high school?
you know where he's taking her?
the storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
i want you to know it's over. we're leaving and we're not coming back.
maybe we should give him some water.
you just ripped my card in two!
you’re wrong about my being there, though. carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  leon saw it, like you, assumed i was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. but carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. he watched it, confronted carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... i don’t know how he knew about the hotel. perhaps carlos talked too much... my husband did not tell me... you more or less guessed the rest...  i didn’t know any of this before you left for los angeles.
i don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
it's nice to see you.
you tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. i guess i'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
god knows i would, sir, but i have a previous engagement this evening.
you came through, nicky.
how do you feel about getting old?
what are you cooking?
eight times.  they've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
but the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
thank you, thank you.  you know, susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the king corporation's moorish manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. and it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  so, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. stop.  say hello.  introduce yourself.  because here, there are no strangers, only friends. and family.  right, jack?
sit down, drew.
how's your shoulder?
why didn't you go before we left?
i wish i had better news... our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  the `cares about people like me' numbers are really in the toilet.  we're off twenty points from march and that was right after we raised interest rates...
yeah i guess so.  you're a neat girl.
you think i have a problem?
sorry, honey, i...
he was sitting here?
what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico?
y'all could be more specific.
hey, sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
--and that mr. marsh paid less attention to you?
what to expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. it's called "nesting."
it seems like ever since i found out about this guy, this name, i've been kind of crazy.  like i was on drugs or something.
gee, uncle lex, i don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
looks and talent don't always go together, katherina.
you may speak.
yeah, well i go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
because, andy. it's a cure.
i don't know you.
captain b-l. willard, sir -- 4th recon group -- i carry priority papers from com-sec intelligence 11 corp -- i believe you understand the nature of my mission.
and if i didn't want to come?
i'm in.
yes?
i've had a--
were you pleased with his work?
they've come for my car.
i know how to tag a damn conch....
come back?
what do we do with the humvee?
stuff it, man!
so it is that you found a girl. well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  i see no profit in it for me.
turn this way.  no, no... not you... you!
my daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  put her on your squad and i'll give you the guns.
oh, god.  i'm awake.
look, young man, the issue is simple. if you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
i've got a plan.  you and val take your truck, get to the mountains. hike to bixby.  get us some help.
wait a second? who was working here today?
these are good.
nick, listen.  from clyde wynant!  "will you take charge of investigation on julia wolf murder. communicate with herbert macaulay".
that's right. she called me. she even asked me what your fathers looked like...
we return to orleans... across the bridge, at the tourelles.
you don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  you understand? no one else. there is no one else.  that man, his son does not exist.  he is dead.  he is dead and who told you to do that?
well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a mrs. lucy delaney. maybe you can ask her.
...to let this happen!
it's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. that's something to be proud of.
is that an insult?  are you insulting me.
richard taupin has become cumbersome.  it would be best if he just disappeared.
that `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you trevor. listen, i don't mean to sound like pollyanna but things could be worse. there's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. you might see things a litlle differently from now on.
i had to tell 'em something.
where's my father?  have you even looked?
hey, sketchy--
yeah.
close enough to walk to!
how do you know this shit?
i wouldn't accept it.  also, i'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
that's the wrong way!
not that late.
did you talk to exley?
well, that's my poor upbringing. i didn't go to no private school. i haven't got no class. i want to live with a writer. not a fucking croupier. i don't even know what the word means. croupier.
right. gotcha.
telly is at steven's. there's a bunch of people over there. come on dance.
perhaps i shouldn't go either.
well, mr. smarty-pants detective, your logic is specious.  what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
you're touchy, sidney - don't be so touchy...
i got your number, mister man.
i want a full-scale investigation.
what are you going to do about it, shoot me?
merely for our records, miss mayfield. it's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
gee, that would really disappoint me.
don't worry. it's really solid this time of year.
no, it's still in my tent. it's...oh my god, she took it.
wow. that's good. lots of capers, huh?
dr. lester, while i am flattered that you share your feelings with me, i believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
oh. well, we can fix up one of ben's for you tomorrow night. sophie insists an black tie.
we were throwing money at him. throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
let's camp.  there's grayling under this ice. i'll snare some for dinner.
she's got to meet you-
when worlds collide.
what about angelina tyler? she was there too.
the lawyer; questadt, he belongs to roth.
how'd you meet marsh?
martinis are for squares, man.
i'll see you.
i've lost interest.
scottie, what are you doing?
the bitched-out babe in back here is one anna tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a blair witch chat room, we all did--
she was taken.
ummm!! they smell delicious.
my love... because i love you.
i think playing in a band called "bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
yo. i'm gonna get buff dude.
good. i hope you like it. it was a long time in coming.
have *you*?
... knock on my door, i'm a total insomniac.
and what, sergeant?
carl smith. he's a medical student. we've known him for years.
i have no evidence of your taking anything. you didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; i was glad to see that. you've been helping us out, you gave us melanie and louis. melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
how long do we stay in here?
god, you're sick.
if i get laid, you won't tell annie?
well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
do you have your own cell?
trust me; do as i ask.
so that's it?  that's the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow?  you spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
you swear?
you don't act like it.
workin' overtime? what are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
help me to get back to earth. where my friends are. they need me.
that's terrific. you did it. you really changed the course of your destiny.
oh, you have group 7 access, don't you?
what did you need?
"in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "how big is it, all told? the estate?
i'm always gonna be that.  but i ain't doing no more buck dancing.
i think i need to call the police. he won't respond...
erik. you don't understand.
yeah - that's all that's worrying you. what do i want?  a chance to feed a wife and kids! i'm a farmer. a job! that's what i want!
i didn't want to leave without saying how much i admire your jewelry.
sir, 655321, sir.
yes, ma'am.
jim feingold, v.p., e.d.a. engineering and data analysis.
every year.
objection, your honor!  counsel is harassing the witness.
dinner's on you.
did you know? had you heard?
it's funny.
hi.
don't curse.
anyway, you want this guy, he's in l.a. we put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the keno room.
jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
ah, my fool is dead.  he was careless, always.  still, i'll pull out your tongue for that.  don't you understand?  i've killed you a dozen times.  your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  i have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  a thousand years, and more. i have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and i have bathed in the blood of emperors.
while greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
marty, you haven't changed a bit!
you know you did wrong.  that's the main thing, isn't it?
captain b.l. willard, g-4 headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
i have to think about my future. and what people expect from me.
the seven ceos of big tobacco... referred to this... said they should be afraid of him... i assume, afraid of what he could reveal.  now, you tell me. what does this guy have to say that threatens these people?
if you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? answer carefully. this is important. you could have gone to the theater last night. there was no game last night.
never touch the stuff. i've got friends all over the world. good friends i can see when i want, if i want.
tell me, damn you!
i'd have liked to have said goodbye.
he was right! pritchett was right!
advice? i'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, ben. unless - have you quit your job? they fired you?
my axe!
hey, quaid!
he doesn't mean anything by it, zack. do you, joe?
yes, ma'am.
probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. he worked a lotta time on this.
would you walk with me down to the paddock?  i'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
where is rae?
attorney for the plaintiff?
let's get the fuck outta here. you're not making any sense, man.
how'd the camera get so high like that?
no. it's useless, robert. it wouldn't work, not ever...
of course i do!
here we go...
come and get you! shit! it's a damn half hour drive each way. why didn't you talk to me about it first?
then don't come any closer.
look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
are you sure?
all it takes is a long arm.
is the helicopter ready?
that machine --
what?
somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
if i say yes, will you take your hand away?
my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. in exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
so what the hell good are you...
no, just a minute or two .. i knocked on your door - no one home, so i followed the music ..
just tell me if anything weird happens.
to the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
what do you mean?
save your breath, ms. thompson.  dr. simms gave me specific instructions. nobody gets to see kristen -- especially you.  she made that real clear.
eugene, at 3:07, this became federal.  why don't i take it over now?
yes...you're not a socialist then?
you won't get away with this!
i think that's about the time i fell asleep.
boy!
you see us as capable of such a blow?
say anything you want... i know you love me and i love you.
uh, yeah, we're getting there.
why are you being so hateful to me?  is this because of lloyd?
so an upstanding member of the aryan warriors wouldn't paint them on. they take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  the queen's house-. the gangster's house-. the clown's house- like that.
cool off, beautiful. didn't you see the sign says "dimout zone?"  there's a war on, you know?
go away.
the idiot speaks.
you look very pretty in it, rose. really, you do.
yup.
why?
it was. what sadness lengthens romeo's hours?
and what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
helena --
in my town, when i was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  but he was not the problem. he had a brother who was worse than he. but the brother was not the problem.  one or the other of them was usually in jail. the problem came when they were both free togther. the two became different from either alone.  alone they were only brutes. together they became lethal, together they killed.
don't worry about me, i'll be fine. i can take care of myself and i'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
we're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
call me from new york before you leave??
i belong with deborah! we're going to south africa!
all right, then, i'll just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
abduction?
norman johnson.
tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
how do you deal with --
it was premeditated -- i knew exactly what i was doing!  i strangled her!  i bludgeoned her! i set her on fire!  i did it!  i killed her!
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video?
save my son, d'artagnan.
enough. i've got to use the phone.
ellie...
so what do we do for money when we get to new orleans?
he will be odd, different.
see anything?
well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
no sweat, alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  what was your per-diem?
i hate snails and blue cheese. especially together.  <u>hate</u>.
i think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
i don't know, honey. i don't know. maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
it's true.  i mean, after this, everything'll be different.
you remember me...?
a little early for a delivery.
dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
we both do.
twenty-one is nineteen.
water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
you come with me -  you stay here.
sorry. it's just so bad lately. you're so lucky you never get pms.
maybe i should drive this time.
and the senate supports you?
feels like warm apple pie, dude.
well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the tv down?
i didn't feel right about doin' that. i takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. that seemed more proper to me, i reckon.
i think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  how does it feel to be dead?
a wise plan. and how is your father? we have missed him at the council.
--what have you been here, nine months?--i been in this business since i was sixteen--
why did you leave me?
you pathetic scum.
what is it you want me to do?
oh, american, thank you. i like them.
can't we hold him?
i think you need your balls reattached.
don, this is my mother.  mom, this is my boss, don palmer.
you're afraid to risk believing. believe in them. believe in your self. take a risk. it will humanize you as a person.
it is, thomas, but of good reputation. come, there is no harm in a drink.
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
do you have any witnesses, major?
is someone with you -- can i get you a drink?
why does this have to be so hard...
we will.
i'm brother frank.
this is all figured at three cents a copy.
for treadstone. in berlin. you know my file. i did a job here. when?
you talk as if this thing's already been decided.
...not until you book it...
gruber...
i am gale weathers!
you do more than try.
i don't know, cole.
please!  face it, colonel, you don't have us, we have you. your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. we figure we ought to hang around a day to check the congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. so if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
what you're telling me, you're tired? you wanna go to bed?
it must be about that appalling script of hers.  what can i say to her? what can i say?
what are you talking about?
yes, goddammit!
thank you, captain pierce.  it's been so long.
mr. helpmann, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the ministry of information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
i don't know -- i'd like to do anything --
well... i ought to be getting home anyway.  the kids'll be back from camp soon.  the house is probably a mess.
what about us?
what?
does it hurt?
we declared war again?  are you scared?
full of beans, ain't you?  but you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
how come there's no punctuation?
i ain't trying to rob you...
the future king!
cat, that's the lamest idea i've ever heard.
you! by christ, you -- i know you.  yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, i know you. you're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
because i'm telling you the truth. i know what's going to happen. there's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon. on july 20, 1969.
it's worth a shot. i can arrange a controlled meeting. a careful dose of sedatives for jason, some security, you and i monitoring. evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
oh, good evening, doctor. rose is a lot better, i just gave her her supper. she's almost all well now.
i should go with her, sandy.
sir. it's quite clear that...
where’s nick sleeping?
we have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
...did i say rude? people can be goddamn cruel. especially some of their housewives. okay, so i've got a weight problem. that's my cross to bear. i dunno...
there's hot cider in the kitchen.
really?
she's blaming herself for sheila.  i know how it feels.  i've been thinking about kristen.  maybe i could've stopped it, if i'd listened.
i'm afraid i have some bad news about your car.
a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty. we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
target locked!
how'd he do?
yeah.  really gets to you if you let it.
what?
dad...
i take it you don't either.  feet.
think of it as special assignment, mrs. peel. with a twist. you're our chief suspect.
hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? we're not a bunch of icy streets here.
we don't need you, frankie.
well you give me the model number of the tent i can order you the poles.
-- instead of what he is --
sorry, doolittle. i've forgotten so much since i've been in here. so much.
yes, and...
see a guy.
good morning, julius. how's our patient today?
no.
just stop.
i didn't think you'd show your face around me again. i figured you were humiliated. you did run away, after all.
agent mulder --
thank you so much for your help mr...?
sorry, dude.
ah, what else indeed? let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
then why did you bring it up?
oh -- i'll take the same, i guess. and coffee.
well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
did miss lawson and mr. marsh ever argue?
son of a bitch!
i know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
wait a minute. i know you. you're kareem abdul jabbar. you play basketball for the los angeles lakers!
got me there.  what's your christmas wish, jonah?
i said i'm fine.
to think i brought my daughters up on all things roman.  read to sleep on catullus, lucretius... virgil... every night.  my beautiful daughters.
duquette.  forget him...
sorry to lose you, baxter.
i couldn't arrive in new york at three in the morning. everybody's in bed.
captain...
then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
what... ?  not you too?
yeah, that's right.
i checked all the zoos. no missing animals. you think a pitbull?
my mother would die.
where's erica? you seen her?
i just need to find my brothers and be on my way, beefy.
thanks for the break. bandit, this here's the dixie chicken.
how'd you get this?
but...
that's not the issue, delmar. even if it did put you square with the lord, the state of mississippi is more hardnosed.
and why were you trying to kill me?
must be somebody?
that's what winston does. he finds people who don't want to be found.
fine, and how are you?
we're two thousand short.
getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
i paid off the mortgage! i ordered that winnebago you always wanted! now you're ashamed of me?
i know you're a dedicated bachelor. that you've had a your wild nights.
i got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  huh? well, i don't know what i'd do without you. you've made up for all the fakes that i've met.
we're not leaving!
four or five years.
you lost my money?
the fuck is wrong with you?
invitations.
spare me.
sucks. so what's up? you some kind of salesman or something?
no, marty, please...
god, these parties are the worst
how long is it going to take?!
where is the glucogen?
maybe i should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
-- sure.
california, i'm going to hollywood to live with the brady bunch.
have you done, mr. cosgrove?
all the data banks in artoo are still secure.
is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
we still think the temporal lobe...
what ten thousand pounds?
peter finch.
jim!
you mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
we got him.
where's who?
then why haven't you detected any signals?  if, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  it'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
it works.  you should try it sometime.
i've just come back from the hospital. your victim has died.
let me guess something. this is your first visit to la la land. you're staying somewhere over in hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  right so far?
i want you to know that i really appreciate you helping me.
that'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
for dana, schmuck.  bring your kid something.  you know.  the dad thing.
-- so when are you going to egypt?
let me help you.  betty schaeter, sheldrake's office.
freaks?...'fraid so, man.  goes with the territory.
this place is a gold mine.
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud."
if the horn be restored the curse is ended.
may we proceed with the business?
do you feel bad?
i wish you'd leave me alone. i want to go away.
i know you didn't. but you a grown girl. you can handle it. i got to.
you wanted to see me sir?
it was a dream, star.
no.
um, paul. on second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend i never said any of that.
that's a terrible idea-
well, i'm in the middle of my goddamn toast here.
it's beautiful.
carol marcus --
...see you tomorrow night.
considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, i don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
i must say i found it rather appalling.
i figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
you want to have dinner?
c'mon, man...
stan and i're okay.
boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
fucking mariners.
...and here is the key to the mini- bar. room and tax has been picked up by cardiff giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
are you embezzling?
yeah?
it's just you and me, then.
do you like this hotel?
you're kidding.
would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- i once saw ringo starr.  or at least i think it was ringo.  it might have been that broke from 'fiddler on the roof,' toppy.
i don't like anything else.
i should kill you right now for what you did to me!
mine!
you bastard! i need a lawyer immediately!
you have to smoke so early in the morning?
he's got money.  in a floor safe in the living room.  i've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  more like brags.  he loves his money.  wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
and it's a shorter commute.
-- yeah.
will i see you again?
look, you're a player... i'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
there's nothing we can do.  it's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  there goes my model.  there goes our last refuge.
and why are you always wearing black? it's so down.  it's totally not your color.  i don't think you have a color.
will this do?
hello mazel tov! a boojee boojee boojee boo...
dignan. you're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
i miss my brother.
i'm having the floor fixed,
why?
mrs. robinson -- i can't do this.
yes.
sam, ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot.
can we take a look at bronty's foal when we're done here, dad?
of what? only god can point the finger, loretta.
it's just business.
my wife's going to have a baby.
this could be it.
you want to mess with superman?
he looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "i'm going to beat you".
he'd act normally when he was with other people. it would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
i can't bear it louis! the machines out there, that fly and that roar! and such lights! they make the night brighter than the day!
i haven't had a crush since i was
you use "richard" again? we're back in paris.
uh, i don't have much money with me right now.
where's ebby?
wellllll, if you read it it must be true. was it in the star, or the enquirer?
yeah, were yuh? i was-i was at an alice cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
now some of this may feel a bit strange at first.  you gotta remember that even a professional politician has some trouble getting used to...
this frightens me -- because i'm starting to feel things i haven't felt in a long time.
the first thing i learned on the job, know what it was? how to spot a murderer. let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. put them all in jail overnight. the next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. if you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
well that's it boys, i been redeemed! the preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. it's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
you won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
how long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
jack the ripper plays shuffleboard.
bobby!
excuse me, sir.  commissioner gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  he asked me to convey his regrets.
no.
wicked.
what are you looking at him for?  any objections, sefton?
sure--i have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. no doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
don't hit me no more, boss! don't hit me! i'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! oh luke. you are an original, you truly are. you really fooled them.
at what point?
dark?
um...who's that?
speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? two hours?  that doesn't even make any sense --
would you excuse us?
well, mickey and mallory can't be together. so, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take mallory first, then you'll come back for mickey.
but, finally, one factor tipped the scales. we received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
certainly.
arizona.
bad luck, i'm afraid.  it's time to die, little bird.
yes. altogether.
you guys have done a nice job.  how bout five dollars?
jesus, what a day. felt like i couldn't've sold ice water in the sahara. jesus. okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. but god, people can be rude. feel like i have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  i'll do one.  my five favorite from the old days at the dodger.
how do you know that?
what would you like to have me do?
much better, thanks.
no. he said they were doing a credit check. are you refinancing a loan?
now vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. i kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
what a team.  see you at eight.
we'll get the paramedics...
naomi, i really value our relationship. i hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
hey--i wanna *scoop*!
isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
you up for it?
you can only do what feels best to you now.
my father taught me.
there's still time, take me up on my offer.
first decent idea you've had in a month.
everybody knows freddie miles.
well, that's interesting, dave. i always liked washington, it's a pretty town.
you see, i've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
another collateral.
so, what are you going to do?
it's okay.  we okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
help vouchers?
look at foley! can you believe it!
which mountains are those dear?
we've gone insane.
what's wrong, doctor?  you seem... lonely.
miss burton? do you still work at wyant wheeler?
i am. i am, sir.
you're kidding.
he's not home, i tell you!
thank you.
i wanna go...just let me go...
i see.  the verdict, yes...
it looks worse than it is. i'm okay.
when?
i heard something like that
what do you like best about your daddy?
it is in my script.
i got an overcoat on.
hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  and assuming what you say is true..
the vice-president...
and you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
c'mon hector.  i know you're crazy but you can't--
god, no.
bang, bang. you're dead.
no more interviews. besides, a doctor's coming over.
what are you talking about?
i'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if i can get the right price.
let me ask you a question, if i may. how do you think she got the job in the first place?  i don't mean to burst your bubble, mantan the marvelous, but sloan is an opportunity.
"octopus people?"
and what does that make you?
do you remember what just happened?
no!  i got to find him.
that's right.
what'd you all talk about?
how we doing, colonel?
respect? well, isn't that progressive.
it's not the machine. there's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... ah there we go! that's a b58/732 when it should be a t47/215 ... tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not buttle.
the attic room is locked --
yeah, okay.
zackly.
benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
that's right.  it's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
i don't think we know for certain.
hypothetically, how much are we talking?
look, marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
it's the damn money men.  you never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  and then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
now why would you do that? put the money in a locker?
on top of the peak.
you can't believe how much he's improved.
what'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
life.  you've stopped living it.  you look, but you do not see.  you listen but, you do not hear.
what do you think?
about thirty million to one.
that perfume you're wearing, antonia. it wouldn't happen to be cristaile, would it?
bob. bet you had a late night.
luke didn't smoke.
th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that polly perfect shit.
don't worry, jennifer.  someday your prince will come.
a student.  i'm studying under dr. macfarlane -- that is, i've been studying until today --
all this is for us?
remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
i'll get in trouble.
what?
i mean, i dunno.  i've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  but never like this.
jack?
sure.
wait a minute.  this is the woman i love.  what's going on? who was loaded?
if by "we" you are referring to men, then i have to say that just the once would do.
sheila... stop...
they're real good.
honey?  how did it go?  you didn't call me.
yeah.
you'll pick up the middle on this one - the jews and negros.
what's the money for?
yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
you represent someone in philadelphia?
you heard me. a gun?  i left mine in the car.
jesus.  well, i do too, sometimes...
is it a gift for your wife?  are you getting a set together? 
what do you mean?
a late night or an early morning?
okay. "dance music for old people?"
ever shot anybody.
as i live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
i'm already familiar with taylor's opinion.
this is going too far, young man.
i'm going with you.
you write gracefully.  calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
oh, and but one word with one of us? couple it with something. make it a word and a...a blow.
so you found peter...
apparently, drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
i don't know.
we're leaving from my house in three hours. if you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
we won't.
when danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled yes, brave sir robin turned about and gallantly he chickened out bravely taking to his feet he beat a very brave retreat bravest of the brave sir robin petrified of being dead soiled his pants then brave sir robin turned away and fled.
that's jazz, my friend.  you said it yourself.  so don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
close up?
you have a question, dr. arroway?
he was different.
just routine stuff.
like what?
i'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  i'm beating you up.
there are so many beautiful women here.
jabez -- will you join our grange now?
#21. way behind schedule. it's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. they see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
i'm terrified.
you're not wearing a belt.
can you move over a wee bit?
hey, how about that!
i've been using since i was twelve! you're all so unbelievably stupid.  you didn't give a shit about anything i did until now!
some kind of circuitry...?
i said, marty, how come you're anal and i gotta go to the psychiatrist?
why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am i glad to see you.
someone better tell mac.
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr. miller took his shirt off --
no, this one doesn't count. it's part of the original one. so then ... until we meet again.
what did you use?
that's the last. the finish. period. some people can learn. some people can't. and you wonder why we never get serious --
melissa margaret marr, celebrity.
and?
tell me why i miss him.
how can you do that man?
but you have problems?
you evil son of a bitch. you better hope there's some thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
the men said, nine.
what?
loretta. what's that smell?
no women allowed.
the one up on the third floor?
it's okay, i am done for.
it's a rip and a hit.
do it.
go on, jill. some of those kids you still know.
i think she would cheer.
stacy...stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the i-told-you-so speech.
like waves. it's never been likes waves before.
is this dr. kurtzweil's residence?
it would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. but no! you had to marry me and spoil everything.
to me?
i'm not good enough for her to associate with, am i? i'm not good enough to even talk about her, am i?
...i...
you told me you were pretty good with youngsters. today i bumped into an old friend of mine, mrs. wheeler  she runs a settlement house down in the village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
that distortion is closing rapidly... opinion, sulu?
none of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
chaplin's modern times! right, toto?
he's dead, rose. your father passed.
no.
geronimo is down.
oh, no.  i'm off that stuff - for good.
you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
i wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
no.
i'm talking to you right now. who's linda?
thank you.
i can't get it to go up.
party ain't started yet, dick.  got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... there's some fellows i want you to meet.
mozart. it was good of you to come.
hi, leonard.
i'm afraid i don't understand.
arbogast.
is it solid?
aw, be a good sport, rose.  you like me, don't you? i like you a lot.
maybe i ought to think about getting another job.
are you kidding?  he'd kill me!
father, please don't die.
only you.
i'll bring back a doctor.
yes, what about him?
you can't afford one?
the queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the master of the revels favours us.
she didn't cone home last night.  we found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
let me see the sick.
i can explain. they attacked me. gas came out of her...well, and then they... and i...
okay... i will...
you name it.
you okay?
i agree with you -- you're not qualified.  so get qualified.  you can insist on being better prepared.  you don't have to just leave it as...  'i don't write.  i'm not schooled. i don't understand the news i'm reading. but at least i'm upset about it, folks.'
not quite -- it seems.  goodbye, jeff.
okay kenny, i'll bet you a hundred dollars you can't light a fart on fire!
what it is?
you think it's cool?
killing her won't solve anything.
so, hi there.  i'm... sister mary clarence.  and you're... young christians.  i guess i should assign you this passage.  what's good?  what were you talking about?
we dedicate ourselves daily anew. something like that.
hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
he wanted a watch, too.
that's good.  cools you right off.  i saw you watching me.
really, now is not the time to make waves.
and you didn't do anything about it?
you start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  we're at a stalemate sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
do you watch the news?  read the paper.  last week, this whole place was underwater.
you stupid son of a bitch! what the fuck are you doing!
nothing for me.  i understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
it was never pentangeli... i've always known that.  it was roth all along.  he talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
like a virgin with an' urgin' in a surgery i'll be swinging -- i'll be bringing out the nurse in me
listen, holly, you want to take a walk with me?
damnit... you were right last night. jonathan and i were into more than sex.  along with bobby vomit, right after old jack grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off grendel records... i didn't want you involved...
no, i can't...
oh yeah sure. why don't i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while i'm at it. i <u>know you</u>...  this is what you do:  go to the house to see her.
jesus...
here now, what are you fixin' to do?
hello, my dearest darling.  so good to hear your voice again.
you play the cello!  it's my favorite instrument.
meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. midnight.
i don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  and i buy my own clothes.  my life's a little boring...
i'd like to go now, rand.  would you mind taking me home?
of course not.
all right then.
i ain't eaten all day.  i just realized it.
you think magruder wants to hang beside me?
why's that?
and remember that trip we took to africa? that safari was so wonderful. me, you... best of friends... forever.
hunt?  howard hunt?
less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
what good will that do?
tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
i'll be up in five minutes.
maybe he's gay.
right, i'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
he did everything he could to take care of his heart?
we'll burn in hell.  both of us.
delivers up to ten at night.  the pope has an obsession with his easter seals.  it's actually not that an unusual set-up.  the secret passageway on the other hand....
you sure?
i'll handle the boss.
look at it this way, however bad i feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
i'm really sorry, max.
tell him i don't want to see him.  tell him he's not welcome here.
i was married to her sister ..
i'm starting to notice that.
i know.  salt and pepper?
where?
yeah, right...
do you think anyone will really come here?
well, who's got access to it?
uh...
he was found in the river.  could he swim?
you know, they told me you were going to be trouble - czurda and scherner.
then what?
you what? a wire transfer of this size?
but what about this "cinderella man"?
i believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  surely st. michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
mrs. brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  neither of you can go.
it wasn't about getting laid.  i just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
such as.
i was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
i don't know. one minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. it's driving me crazy.
what are you doing out here?
it must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
in sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
now's a helluva time to play "what if".
i can think of another word.
yeah it was all just an accident.
i want romance.
why?
five years is a long time.
well, it's a terrific yard, chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps?
you do something for me, dil?
have you ever know a woman? do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
look. go on, look.
well, who knows? maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
don't be such a baby.
they're --  -- what?
you're right. you're right. i don't know what i was thinking. i'll tell you what. it doesn't have to be published. nobody ever has to see it. i'll just keep it for myself. no one will ever have to know it exists.
well, we'll ask around.  let you know if we hear of anything.
i'm curious about you.
that kind of talk is between us. don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
two minutes, alvy.
the monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
that's easy for you to say, bianca.
dad! get us outta here!
where were you?
no.
you know you just do this for shock value. it's not shocking.
okay, what do you want? what dumb favor do you want me to do?
then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
me neither. i've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. you think yours did?
it's not like he's a young man. he's had time to live.
it's a breeze.
do we get to wear a crown?
don't you use olives?
i do drink, baron -- i drink to you, baron and to win.  it's good, -- come along, baron.
is that your signature, rico ?
will...?
how much?
and ...your friend?
oh, it's okay, then.  'cause you're just taking out the garbage...
-- do you wanna cup?
i don't see a control panel, or an access port.
well, think.  because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
with all she was doin'. with all the shit she kept doing! you stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
are you sure?
my air isn't... i'm coming back.
-- hey! --
ilsa, i --
ro, how long have we known each other.
o-kay. we'll skip that question.
me?  internal medicine.
was he morose, or...?  i mean...
it's will graham...
something wrong?
my god, what happened here?
where's everybody?
tell him the state of mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
just a little, you know... bicentennial memento.  nothing special.
i don't sell my work by the yard!
god ... this can't be true.
oh, thomas! she has cut my strings! i am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
pardon me, madam. they phoned through from the mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
...the...

yah.
little high.
simon, what's happening?!
let the party begin.
really?  too bad.
aren't you meeting mr. sheldrake?
flaws.
i'm sorry, basil, i thought she was a man.
i admire a man with a sense of humor.
well, i...
lemme ask you a question.  ever fuck a mutant?
...then we won't need to tether miss starling as our lure.
oh, kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
oh, he-he didn't say anything.
sulu. when did he find the time for a family?
why couldn't you stay here with me?
i am sir lancelot of the lake, from across the sea. i am the best knight in the whole of christiandom, and i look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
come back tomorrow.
ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. the toughest shot on the last frame.
he's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
so there never was a phase two rescue team?
we're almost married.
ask me what i don't have.
eleven.
that's word for word.
listen meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
... but all the decision of that officer ...
foreman now.
he knows his alphabet.
you mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
no whistles, but a club you bring a hack -- ?
here, mom.  drink this.  you know, you're awful.  you probably were flirting.
what's that?
first han, now you.  when am i going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
wait.
"the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
how wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
beam the vulcan up -- and we talk.
no, i don't think that's very much fun. let's play house instead.  you be the friend who comes to see me.  i'll show you my children.
now what?
what'd we here, georgie?
i don't know what you're talking about.
i do.
hey jack, you’re all flush.  i guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
and then?
i'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
no -- we're going to attack the termites!
this business, captain?
yes... that's what i pray for...!
by the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
i didn't agree to three points over the vig.- what am i nuts? i didn't need it that much.
elsa never really believed in the grail. she thought she'd found a prize.
that's not fred madison?
that guy treats women like objects, man.
are you peggy sue kelcher?
saving a lady in distress, eh? well, i suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  incidentally, we'd better get started. you'll have to pack.
i can explain about the portal, darling.
you mean we get `dave' to nominate you as vice president.
don't snap at me like that. you're lucky i don't punch you right in the face.
full up.  i got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by la cienega.
i didn't say it bothered me.
no. dr. larch will be performing the procedure.
we can live in a hacienda.
with that ten thousand dollars i could build a tabernacle that'd make the wheeling island tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
is anyone there?
is it?  i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
... am i dead?
i'm buying bananas tonight.
red flag, man.
so, you're looking great, how have you been?
i am a patriot. i love my country. can you understand that?
whatcha doin'?
last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
her name is karen sumpter, from near dell city. just disappeared a couple weeks back. vanished.
we know that.
come on, ben, come on...
hey lloyd. this looks like another one of your mix tapes.
i don't think so, claude. you'd just slow me down. we'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. there's no way around it, you're soft.
it's funny you would mention rose, i was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  or maybe it isn't so funny.
your friends at warren, putnam and hudson.
gentlemen, the past.  unfolding before your eyes.  stand back from the field.  it'll blow you to bits.
we give it one more hour. did the photographer do the dogs?
oh - nothing. no extra charge.
...they never caught that black dolya killer, huh?
i want it back now. i never should have taken it off, i want it back.
the place is falling apart.
wait a minute --
yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
no!!! no!!!
do you know i turned down "frankenstein"?
oh yes, oh yes you did! you've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! why didn't i see it yesterday! bad luck! is that all i'm ever gonna have? why didn't i just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? i'm gonna marry him!
no. it is too judgmental.
i suppose you're in your taxi?
i needn't keep you any longer, mr. clarendon.
yeah, i guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
yes.
can you describe the relationship between mr. kramer and his son?
you don't like jam. you hate jam. you never eat jam.
did we get it?
this way lex.
did you eat?
right!
yes. friedman’s the fuckin’ austrian!
i thought your specialty was good-bye.
i said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
you have a point there. that's a very good point. we're having an affair. right. an explicitly sexual relationship. your needs. my needs. you're absolutely right.
what is it? you want to help me, you feel sorry for me? keep it to yourself.
now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  all you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, ellen.'
your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
please don't make this personal --
do you feel all right, sir?
three weeks. i had to rent some equipment.
even i have trouble with that sometimes. earth is in outer space. and we're in inner space.
after the kids are back in school.
pows?  i don't know.  but either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  cream?
all this apparatus, vicki... this house, and the money, and the power ... it was never mine. it was something i inherited. bruce wayne was something i inherited.  all i ever hoped for was someone who could see through bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
we could cut a demo.  look for a label.
i'll help you in.
what else? shit, principal cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
we're just having a little drink.
i guess so. you want to help me watch frank?. i'm going to stake out frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
watch how it eats!
what are you talking about?
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader. you employ readers, don't you?
i mean, it could get us both killed.
that's what you were saying.  i heard what you were saying.
t-turned on?
one of the reasons i love you, marty, is that you're almost as crazy as i am. please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? just bright colors. can you tell the difference?
totally. the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven.
he told me he had done two others just like it.
pornos.
there's two of 'em, lou!
no, i'm not -- i've got some packing to do. i'm also going back to paris today.
it is johnny.  he came all the way from california to be at the wedding.
captain norrington... i appreciate your fervor, but i am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
it's jus' till we get some distance. then you can come out.
wait until he is on the stairs.
can't you like just divine it?
five years of it. surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
all right. at a quarter to five.  say, why don't we get married in marseilles?
okay.  what'd you spot...?
look who's talkin'! jes'! he got married! vince got married!
i can completely understand your distress, sir.
forty-five minutes.
it sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. it seems to me she has the right idea--.
your grandfather wore that in his service to the king, and i to fight for the duke.
now is that little prick still here, because if he is, i'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
carmine left?
hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
there's seven ashtrays in this room, duffy.
i felt guilty. 'cause i "owed so much" to alice. but even then i was starting to wonder. is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? if you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. you grow older but you don't grow up. you turn into -- into --
can i help?
it's always been this way here.  we work on the towers all our lives. when we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
no!
i have heard many confessions, d'artagnan.  but even if i were not a priest, i could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
i'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
let me guess:  another short circuit?
it's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, i'll handle it for you. everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
where is earth?
again with the orders from you! you got a napoleon complex chief, and i'm getting sick of it!
i'm a soldier -- we're at war.  i can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
no, i'm not putting up with this.
whatever! it's no dig on you, archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- the allemeinischer zeitung, le figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
is that what i did?  dave?  i humiliated you?  my god...i'm sorry...
i tried to save him! i was desperate to save him! he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
mookie!  how is anybody gonna call in?
it was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
no!
because this guy's a fucking psycho. and if you think joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off i am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
hold still, del, we're just talking here...  then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. it's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
someone should stay with mr. smith.  what if he wakes up?
here.  go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
oh yeah?
who?
as an idea.
now that i'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
i don't know yet.  i should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
i didn't know you could fly a plane.
yeah.
sorry, pat, out of beer. you like vodka?
in my country, i am a magico.  a man with a dream.  a man on the rise.  to take nothing and make it something, okay?  i have failed my dream, but i will accomplish.  that is why i am in your country.  yes, i lose my freedom. but they do not take my dream.  do you have a dream, george?
your life?
is that who you're waiting for?
i need to know where tyler is.  can't you help me?
that's enough!
don't see how. i think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. no, trust me -- disaster pics. and air hockey.
i never pay for anything. they just keep me here to amuse the guests.
oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
yes, she committed suicide yesterday. that's not news. i heard about it last year.
they don't arrest people for having feelings.
mulholland drive.
right.
so what are you thinkin' here?
who is it?
ohh!
doesn't work that way.  you had your chance, now fuck yourself...
number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  who's he?
i fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, mr. torrance.  i fear that is the only thing to do.
there is a 20th century possibility.
the door was open.
all the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  forget her.  take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
were you recently in the bathroom?
...which one are you?...
..this week's tke kegger...
drive in.
what did he say?
nothing.
no, sir.
no we can't. we can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to california now, right now, before it's too late.
trust you and harry lee.  remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit fort louis?
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father.
my god, all this time...i never stopped loving you...
simone?
neat. let's try it out on j.f.k.
i didn't.  i didn't. i mean, i did, but then i did exactly what you told me to do, and i came right back.
ted! what are you doing? you can't fly this plane!
where downstairs?
for once in my life, i am not the issue.
if he were still alive, maybe.
it's all right with me. is he here?
sounds like you were in an accident or something.
oh! and don't wave your hands about!
you know i never could stand your sarcasm.
oh my g-d, you've been robbed!
salvatore. my young caesar. first me, sallie. then you.
who's been giving you history lessons?  your bartender?
wait a minute. you talked to elaine this morning?
who pays the rent on time.
meetin' him at the gate. that phone call this afternoon was the signal. my deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. but of course, i know exactly where they are.
yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in bloomfield hills.  now, i don't give a shit what they do.
i heard in the federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your daddy on father's day.
well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. unfortunately, i have to keep certain parts of my life private.
w...what?
what?  no menthol?
could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
you sure you don't want a lift back home?
no.
here's five hundred -- put it in your glove.
and?--and?--
what makes you think he's my friend?
let me think about it, o.k.?
i want to go back to vienna.
central intelligence agency -- c.i.a.
why are you in new orleans? if you don't mind my askin'.
to hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
just wondered what?
jesus.
nope.
what's your name?
twisted?
oskar - my friend lena.
long enough to call victoria a ho.
is that all you wish to tell us?
let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
i want to talk to him.
...do we?
yeah, he's in there.
girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  are you? are you? how about you, nolan?
what's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
he holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
it's delicious, trust me.
just stick close to chewie and lando. i've taken care of everything.
i'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for dysentery.
hi, can i come in?
eddie, is it all right if i get personal?
well... i can't think of anything.
come one, that was so weird.
hmm.  you know that's  really a shitty middle name!
but i've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
the mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. a physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
mr. yelburton will be busy for some time.
mr. white, i am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
so... what does it do?
kittridge.
i got all my signatures.  one hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than i need!
we... have a history. i'm sorry. you wanted the procedure. you wanted it done... to get past. i have to finish in there. it's almost morning. we'll talk later.
can you beat that? i always knew talby was weird.
maybe you could remember something that -
there's nothing in there about ruby.
they rival the angels of paradise.
why would my father send this to me?
pardon me, i am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
have a pleasant evening.  will you have tea, mister welles?
you've got a comeback for everything, don't you, danny? you use 'em like some sort of shield.
i'd seen you writing in that book. at the embassy in cairo, when i had thumbs and you had a face. and a name.
don't do that again!
shit, we just started.  but i better log out of this.
ha-ha-ha. i'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. that shit robs you of your ambition.
how do you do.
never.
i mean i've checked everything. women.  liquor... finances.  i went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
they're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  no more drills.  we stand at full ready starting--
because i'm trying to build your self-esteem. you're far too sensitive.
ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
b & w may have threatened litigation... cbs is on the block...  but you, i mean, i know how...
i only ask so i can call you when the arrangements are made.
<u>there never was a jason bourne</u>.  you have to come with me.  it's the only way.  we can give it back to you...
i'm not a thief.
that club sucks, they card everybody. let's just party at your place.
oh, what, what do you do?
what is the fascinatioon?  it is only a leaf.
being with stephanie has opened my eyes. she's not uptight or controlling. she's just cool. things are so easy with her. smells different. tastes different. fucks different. fucks like an animal. i'm telling you, i went deep last night, miles. deep.
you look like an eighties rock band.
it's always stood there, miss connell.  i can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. i'm afraid it will have to remain.
i'll tell you another thing.  we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution, now we lead with television commercials. we're the best, it's as simple as that.  even the americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  we've got the lot.  nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  that food you're eating.
it's still not going to work! they'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
that's 'cause he's dead.
good evening. how are you feeling?
a merger?  how long will you be gone?
at that close range, we won't last long against those star destroyers.
what do you want of me?  i'll give you anything you want, but do what i ask!
yo! jean, this is ramellzee.
you ever do any hunting, peter?
you throw mighty far, jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
i'm sorry about my parents.
we're having a party for you, boy. cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. junior cringes away from the light.
okay, okay!
no.  go ahead.  you're gonna be great.
yeah, watch the road!
she must have been in a good mood when she said that. she usually calls me loud.
and how many ghosts have you caught, mr. venkman?
hi enid.
yeah, natalie. it's hair. it grows.
well sure, colonel --
stupid cunt!
is there a problem?
we've got her sister. testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. this is the point.
i'll pass the word on, then.
son, you're an ant after my own heart.  a warrior.  an ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
will you pardon me?
how am i being shitty?
well, it's the only way i can be satisfied. if i use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
do it for you.
oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  all englishmen are ugly.
look, i've been working this case for months now...
around twenty. security pretty lax. they almost always just deal in boxes. rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. on a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from israel. they're like a way station. they are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to vermont.
that's it.  my client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
ok. mister stansfield, norman stansfield.
clean.
wouldn't dream of it.
this isn't your room. you're in 304. i fucked up.
do you have anything to eat?  and the orange one -- what about the orange one?
some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.

you're joking.
you're serious.
his name wouldn't be steve, would it?
how's that 700 bucks coming?
adrian -- you?  you killed blake, and --
someone's following me.
it's not a combination lock.  it takes a key.  he keeps it on him all the time.  i mean all the time.  it scratches up against me when we do it.
you okay?!
i don't like it!
things have changed. circumstances, jerry. beyond the, uh... acts of god, force majeure..
certainly, monseigneur, does not your excellency consider her worthy of love?
-- i'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. didn't matter how much cash i made pulling wet jobs -- i was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like jon archer after me.  the best part is -- i'm the good guy.
i guess it's a combination you don't often see. apparent attraction..
well done, lad.
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
you're fucking psycho.
so start at the beginning...
oh no.
what's this?
a harmless joke.
you wouldn't.
it was an accidental. i don't want to go into the details. it was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. i mean, obviously, since swifty's dead. that's why anthony never graduated.
how'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  get undressed. i want to see you.
forgive me if i have offended you.
you said you weren't always impotent.
don't worry about the damn phone.  i won't answer it.
sure.
the virus itself might have positive applications.  they'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  greg isn't joining us?
i'm leaving. i'm getting out.
he's okay, clair.  you wanna give him a little room?
we saw it in the office.  it went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
yes i'm sure i hit the right commands.
your old files -- ?
i understand.
are you going to eat your lunch
under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
which island of hawaii do you want our house to be on? maui? kaui? molokai?
i don't see why not.
what?
door's locked. nothing there.
when you say, i can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
did you bring along something to read?
stay away from my family!
i don't know.  how long before it kills us?
hello, miss sessions. i don't believe we've had the pleasure.
nigger, get real. you touch jayne kennedy she'll have you ass in wayne county so fast -
don't you have friends?
of course you'll go!  you're going to fly the helicopter.
but, skipper, cougar's been picked for top gun...he's the best of the best!
me too.  for the most part.
for god's sake, will you please go now?  we gave you every nickel we got.
this man gordon liddy--he's going to be tried along with hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
i think you are rather innocent, my friend. in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, jethica?
no.
what?!
no, mikey.
..."find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- i guess a lot of dads say that -- but i did and it just took off.
i know if i had to pick, it'd be "choke," or "devil."
you hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
rioting both sides of the bay, in chestertown they burned the customs house and tar-and-feathered the customs agent.  he died of burns. in wilmington they killed a royal magistrate and two redcoats.
the closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
he already knew it.
himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. he's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
oh cripes. do you have change for a dollar? all i have is these stupid nepalese coins.
... illegal search of lindenmeyer' s duplex. eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. twenty—four citizen complaints. and the calls are just starting to come in...  i forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
negative.  negative.
take a look at this.
say it over and over again, leon. words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
something was rattling around. some loose tools.
we have more in common than you think, wendy dear. i loved summer camp when i was young and i love it now. it's important. between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who i once was...i get recharged. now who's the dork?
sure.
yeah.
earth ii.
... as young as they want, you mean. and i'm not interested in whether thousands of people think i'm six or six hundred-

you gotta excuse him. yesterday he didn't know pinot noir from film noir.

i will loan you the money.
what are you implying, scully?
what?
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
i can't believe that, harry.
i had to increase the dose. you're building up a resistance to the serum --
the house is in flames, benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
so it is going to happen after all.
go.
yes, i'll be there.
what are you doing here in the trailer court, deputy?
what are you making:
ow! i'll kick your butt!
...i don't think i know that hospital.
paul, don't let them die.
whoever sent you knew what they were doing. you and yorgi are practically twins. two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
waited too long, hon...?  
we'll never find the baron's castle.
what now?!
frank loves you. you know that... but i've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
jordan.  you watch your ass.
30 seconds...
the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property i've aquired.  that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg.  but that's where you come in.
you a fine lookin' woman, jackie. i bet you do a damn sight better than okay. you think anybody followed you?
... no...! ` kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. he touches kirk with gentleness as jim recovers, opens his eyes.
oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  you threw a knife at my head!
me too.
ahh, mr. hockney. do join us.
your aunt?
smile... good?
don't call me that --
down i would say... what would you say?
well, just get it off your chest, son.
the key word here is talk, dante. i think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
are you supposed to take that many?
what do you think this plan is, edgar? a nuclear attack?
i didn't say that.  i said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." that's what i said.
but keaton had. edie finneran was his extradition advisor. she knew who he was and what he knew.
i thought you were taking me to see mama?
i need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
no.  she shall not be left here.
...happen if i drop this?
bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
i can't believe that price prefers mcdermott's card to mine.
you're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  and it's drawn to you.  you don't like that.
"american president"
take your time, jer.
sump'n got to happen soon. we got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. after that...  an' rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
your bankers want an answer about the brazilian tv stations
no, he covets. that's his nature. and how do we begin to covet, clarice? do we seek out things to covet? make an effort to answer.
what does that mean?
i'm telling you. can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! they come rollin' out like oranges!
you feel alright today, daddy?
insolent young cub!
madam will dress now, it is late.
what are you talking about?
soon, all the electrical secrets of heaven shall be mine.
he's very caring, in his way.  you haven't seen him at his best.
what do you think you're doing? you're going to get us arrested.
yes.  no.  both.  when i was a boy, i see movie at school called "it's a wonderful life" directed by frank capra. ever since i want to come to america. land of the free.  home of the brave.  a land where anyone can be anything. as long as they are white.
tonight?
i feel nothing, geordi. it is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
i'll tell you what i am - i'm the paterfamilias! you can't marry him!
you been wearing rubbers, billy-boy?
it's my job!
to my own special sissy. cheers! and welcome. so my letter brought ya flying, eh? where were you? salt lake city? la conner? well, i may have a little surprise for you. but first, tell me about yourself. it's been six months, hasn't it? in some circles that's half a year. how are you?
he's not a president! he's an ordinary person.  i can kill an ordinary person.
you have everything, kimberly? credit card, cell phone, aaa card?
welcome, mr. kane, to the "enquirer." i am herbert carter.
your love.
come in, please. come in. can i get you a cup of tea?
no. you listen to me.  you busted me, miles. you left me with nothing! what did you expect me to do? get a degree in counseling? write a book about table linen? because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, i'm not quite ready for that.
you know what gets me about that cadillac?
i know of no one.  but even if there is, i am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
has sue got it right?
the posies are for her?
no. the pill will be for birth control. but girls do like sex. maybe not the first time.
how about bari?
who?
ummm...what? i didn't hear you.
yes, i know.
well, what's the difference? i just need it.
who's grown up?
that's what you said?
jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? that he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
just a little joke. see you later, old friend.
i guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
it's not me, it's the engine!  a fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
don't care for cold steel?  a knife is worse than a bullet?
no, it just struck me as odd...i don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
elsa. elsa don't. elsa. elsa. give me your other hand, honey. i can't hold you.
he saw the girl in the car...
there's nobody left around here now.
-- but he does seem very nice.
you want those assholes, you want top dollar.
i don't know what the problem is. plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
you understand what he tells us?
i went to sophie's and she was very hospitable.
you couldn't?
where's michael?
sure did. dropped the big one on them.
he did love you, you know. nick. he did love you.
it is the truth.
that's not the point.  in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
- you who don't have a conscience.
is that a birthday cake?!
okay.
jeanne... the men are exhausted!
why didn't you tell me?
what?
put it down as a gesture to love.
i sent telegrams, i guess the military traffic held them up.
really?
just an idea, but let's just fucking split. we'll meet up anywhere. akron or austin or atlanta. anywhere...
but the captain ordered you hard to starboard.
never?
oh, god, you should've seen what i looked like then.
the problem is i don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
no -- neither do i. but...  but this man is a christian and he has written --
it was my fault. i was right downstairs. i should have gone up with him.
i have always loved him.
sidney is a liar!
is that all it's been? i thought it was longer.
those things in your hands.
dixie mccoy
you've been divorced for two years already. people move on. she has! it's like you enjoy self-pity. makes you feel special or something.
i guess i owe you one.
is callie still around?
first wes, now you?
c'mon...
he's got goodness, mabel. do you know what that is?
okay, let's cut to the chase. he's afraid of cats, what's that about?
i can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
you seem... disturbed.
hello.
that's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  when do you think you'll need me for real work?
so that's what love is?
well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  so yeah, i took a look.
i have been at the library.
g'day, they say it's worth three grand...
i am.
i worked for him... still do.  said he'd make sure i was left alone if i helped put wade away.  he kept his promise for twenty years.
he's lying! i am.
rafe's girl, evelyn?
oh, i'm sorry. does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
yeah.
we were back on.
i got a dress.
i knew this would happen. soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee, i knew there'd be trouble. he's just got some kind of influence over her i can't decipher. there's somethin' wild in lula i don't know where it comes from. you gotta find 'em, johnnie.
ssh. don't want babe to hear.
see ya later.
it's not what you think it is.
what about childs?
... compliments, mr. poe.  take her and get out.
well, like yourself, doctor jones, i have a passion for antiquities.  have a look over here. this might interest you.
yeah. yeah! the way people used to do it. quick and dirty, like ripping off a band-aid.
yeah.
there's no light back there.
a big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
aww, naw, amy, that won't be necessary. i shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, i guess.
they only made the one episode. they've shown it about nineteen times.
thank you billy, from the baby and me.
it got him....
wade, it's late. i know you're probably at toby's, but i'm in bed reading. we got different habits.
see, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
i didn't know. i saw him die. i believe he's dead. christ
all right, y'all gonna go with me?
even the birds sitting out there. it does look very much the same, mitch. this could be last week.
okay, jammer.  no problem.  you stay right here. i have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  we'll stay in voice contact.  just hold onto the rope.  five more minutes.  okay?
it's four in the morning... i'm going to go to sleep.
yes, i just found it on the step.
did you get married real young?
yes, mary patrick?
yeah.
i hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow i doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
what about?
she didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  i'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
you were supposed to act as if everything was real.
what's wrong with making friends?
run!
but if we take their money and supplies...
what's happening?
oh please sod off.
brian mccaffrey...  oh this is really a treat. brian mccaffrey. lost a dad to the animal, huh?
is there anything to understand?
say, you need anything, snake? guns? explosives? i can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
he shot a hole in the damn ceiling. so what?  you lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
i think that'll hold it.  hello shirley. just helping someone tie up a christmas present. how are you?
you mean we'd be dead?
how amazing.
take all the time you like, doctor.
he used to know me.
who?
tell me mr ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
you're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
this house is sacred to him.  it's the source of his memories -- his rage.  mrs. strode, i beg you.  don't let your family suffer the same fast as laurie and her daughter.
oh, i don't know... satan?
right on -- he's been waiting for --
i'm not anymore.  i haven't, i haven't been in television for a year.
tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, i'm threatening to blow the whistle.
all injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
you mean you don't know, henry! we got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on janovska street here in the old town, and you don't know about it?
i don't know, are we?
what happens on page 87?  have you ever read page 87?
oh... well... have you heard from barnett?
i have no idea.
naw. they got some blue dye, though. you think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
as a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
...maybe we should never have come back.
gone.  destroyed.
you talked to walt?
it's already been called off. witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  did you find out where the bomb is?
if my universe had a hub...
forgot your keys --
no. it's a lot further than that.
it's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
so it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
that's cute.  you're funny.
sorry, ms. heller. i think they're used to me teaching.
sh! hurry!
come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  and nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  you could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  let me buy you a drink.
what's emergency landing plan b?
yeah. and they say smokin' is bad for your health.
look, i don't want your money!
i ... i'm not gonna do it.
atta, girl!
to chocolate?
my son, why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer? is that your penance? is it?
what did you tell them?
well, i wish you luck. it is a treacherous business.
do you renounce satan.
nothing.
he wants me to go to cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  i said i would.
but, sir...
let it go, claude.
back there. you said "the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
are you all right?
come on sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  this is not a personal thing, this is business.
adrian.  what are you doing?  why wouldn't you let us in?
shut the door!
don't hang up!
come on. come swimmin' with us.
it goes from henry viii.  henry viii, edward iv, mary, elizabeth i, james i, charles i, charles ii, james ii, william and mary, ann, george i, ii, iii and iv, victoria, edward vii, george v, edward viii, george iv, elizabeth ii.
yes, it's a girl i saw at the station.
it won't take but a minute. it's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. our lady of the helpless granted her a favor.
really.  what are you writing about.
i'm sorry, did you just call me "lotte"?
what're your taking down?
give'em another pill...
i'll handle this from here, sweet   owes us a little restitution.
so...? where the hell is it?
for sixty seconds, maybe!  look at this!  you could-
i think i... i think i killed him. i stabbed him with something and he fell.
i'm sorry...i....
but i'm not on the outside. i'm in here.
how long's this whole thing gonna take?
he's a gentleman. gentleman gambler. he gets his kicks playing with hustlers. he's got an old southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
where are you from, henrietta?
and now?
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan. i painted it after joseph beuys died. a rebirth painting. i felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
in one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  all that because of your criminal savagery!
can you isolate the wave?
oh, my god.
sure.
yes.
don't rub it in.  i live here.
i don't believe it.
he was aiming a huge spear right at me!
maybe ma'll have pork for supper. i ain't had pork but four times in four years--every christmas.
the hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  it was a put-up job?  but where was the, where was the money in that?
no. thanks.
jim... you are my best officer and if i had a best friend, you'd be that too. but i am commander, starfleet, so i don't break rules!
i don't know.
... her father.
i tell you - this is the only way to travel.
when you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
i sent a trunk home yesterday. this is all i have.
one of your secrets.
yeah. i got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. all i need's a stake and a  chance --
that's right. and you also know that even though i make 23% of the modems in the world... i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
look, i'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  but this experience went beyond both.  for the first time i had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. that it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
end of the line.
you know, linda. i've finally figured it out. it's not sex i want. anyone can have sex.
plato!
...oh, come on! you think the same thing!
i wonder, if red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
oh shit.
i'm not gonna kill it.
where is it?
thanks for coming.
it doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
have you told richard low about amarillo?
so they travel around from place to place and preach?
and what had you done?
now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
again? good idea.
you're trying to save sparazza?
i can understand that.  everyone feels that way about someone.
there's one coming.
frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
it is unlikely. america, perhaps. there is great anti-communist feeling in america.
have you canceled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
i know better than you do.  love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
scully?
i know you do, darling.
gimme water.
i might have fallen asleep before i did.
hey, you wanna bet?
do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created!
sid 6.7 is now armed.
do you mind if i borrow it?
we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight -- the first major event of the bicentennial year... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. i would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- jimmy michaels.
where are we?
you missed fourth amendment law. unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. where were you all afternoon?
say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
anthony, i --
we just thought...
and how many lives have you destroyed?
i dunno... i always feel like everybody secretly hates me. i'm just paranoid i guess. i mean, you like me don't you? we're good friends, right?
you got a great mom. i'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
i don't accept that.
ouch!
are you open?
goodnight, lydia.
look, i haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
you going to call the police?
you don't believe that either, do you? why can't you see my side?
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually one guy and--
i couldn't wait till tomorrow.
if you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. there's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. if you're going to talk nonsense, i don't want to talk to you at all. rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
they know, i had no choice. get out of the house now! do you have a laptop?
what?  where is she?
maybe i've just got the creeps.
no.
if the pay's right i'll do it.
very well!  now that i know it, i will no longer love her.
huh?
what do you think?
i will close.
say what you want and you'll see --
maybe i'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, sefelt.
billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
murphy to epps.
doctor, this is da mayor talkin'.
who's it for? a relative?
'bout twelve.
chicken feed.  if gus gorman can push the right buttons ---
i don't know.
so what? everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. i'm fuckin' sick of it.
no i'm really grounded. when i got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
what's that noise?
he's asking everybody questions.
i can see nothing's changed.
is that your car?
in my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
*who*! miss--! is that--? why didn't you--? holy smoke;  h-hello... yes, miss paine... how-- how are you, miss paine...? what?... escort *you* gee--i mean--*sure*-- *yes*! i'd be--. reception for a *princess*! gosh!... thanks, miss paine. yes. i--i'll be there! goodbye, miss paine.  did you hear that?--escort susan paine--reception for a princess! imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
i'm feeling very fit, thank you. how is your bronchitis?
i do not recollect, your majesty. will that be all?
especially tonight.
i'm very tired, george.
as a representative of moscow...
visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
he looks great, though, doesn't he? i have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  it's great.
trust me, i understand. i just want to say something to you, grady.
the pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  the blood. the blood is horror.
but... you may not be well enough.
hmm?
that's right, of course.
i want something i can print!
what do you mean, you think so?
--how old?
did you get the paint?
are you my man?
don't try your powers on me.  try looking into that place where you dare not look. you'll find me there staring back at you!! you bene gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  here i stand.  but... i will never be yours.
i'll bet a dollar.
claire.
ya gotta keep tabs on your "eleanors", memphis. cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
yes sir.
i like my job.
i'd also like it noted --
i better give you my address then.
no - that's not it!  she said her boyfriend stranded her up there! i didn't ask her to come with me!
mhravitch.  remember that name.
i only owe you a ride, vincent.
oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for christmas.
you were injected with glucose. there is no plutoxin 7 virus. you were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
at a gas station.  will you marry me?
i feel faint.
what way is that?
hey, what do you want to do?  grow a beard?
with your support, horatio.  as one of our own who has seen combat with the british, your opinion counts.
- good.  then if you manage to get hold of ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of chimera on earth.
you're doing great with her.
bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. you just can't do it.
him?
whatsamatter?
who?  that tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
hi guys.  oh holy fuck.
dave ferrie - you know about him?
you snore at night.  that bugs me.  can i take you out?
i killed him myself.
what is all this stuff?
but i'd arranged to go home with you myself.
i'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  let's talk about tomorrow. wanna do something?
it's your deal. you sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
just lying there.  we're taking a nap.
no. you killed her. manager remembers you going into her room. your fingerprints were found all over the place.
i had a lunch break so i thought i'd come by and see you. your teacher is a fox!  why don't we discuss that after class. but the burning is totally normal.  oh look. class is over already.
that’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
you ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades, mister.
it wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
i uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
kept us warm for twelve years.
look, i'm sorry.  i know you said not to talk, but when i saw the crowd i just got excited...
oh. huh. well...  congratulations again, vicki. that's wonderful news.
mr. gardiner, i'm morton hull, the producer of 'this evening.'
take my horse and go to the compound. give this to mrs. wu.  she'll help you.  hurry!
oh please.  another one.
there!
which way?
mr. zammito?
you're what?
you raised me, like a son.
nice conversationalist!  yeah, i felt 'em a little, but i ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
time's getting short.
no, but...
sorry.  i'll be on the bandstand.
everything stays as it is!
but playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. they cannot make it true.
no -- no, thanks.
we're leaving, jason. we're leaving now.
rob.  top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the '80's and '90's.  subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
oh, of course.  i understand.  at least, i think i do.
not a soul.
please, please, that's what we're here for.  be careful, that hurt.
bill...this is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. but i think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
you don't give him enough credit chas.
why?
oh, i forgot to tell you. while you were unconscious, i injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. it's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now i've attached it to your left ventricle.  a little trick i picked up from the borg.
as the same time, i wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
that's what i'm saying, will. you'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
is that really what you want?
he's too drunk.
hello marylin.
and, i'm sorry, who are you again?
go hard!
it means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand.
why is it important to you? if i inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
i would make you rich.
he's gotta be a nut!  he saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
how did you find out about the toxin?
she wasn't certain... i never really showed her.
yeah?
peter, i... i...
and when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction xj6 was really about...
you do it.
this is only a vaudeville.
why were they going to arrest you?
you're <u>happy</u> for me and victor.
i thought the fbi test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
they recruited me when i was in high school.
what did you see?
josh said...
us??  we'll never catch them.  any- way, we're all done, teemo.  let's go home.
no problem, elliot. i'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. actually, i'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. understand, if dick didn't assure me you're good people i'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. but, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: i gotta friend in the department.
where did this body go?
town's out of lilacs.
hawk, all i need is one ding on the volvo and presto! there are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from cincinnati.
i'm just talking.
i don't know.  at a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  my central nervous system was telling me something. jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so i could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what i like to do anyway.  and i'm chipper because you finally showed up.  i thought i'd cook for us. tequila and eggs sound good?
yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
yello?  oh, ripley.  hi...
i'm a historian.  it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
what?!
that's real good. you ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. bible tells you that much. hit tells some things that don't seem right too, i reckon. i guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  you don't touch yourself, do you?
well hurry, before we sink.  should i give you my telephone number in venice?
no. they didn't fire her.
yeah, deal. give me the two dollars.
did he make your life miserable?
we did a piece last year. 'ingenue dykes in hollywood.'  her name got mentioned.
but i'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. i'll bet you're lonesome.
goldmouth? they say he was born out back behind the shithouse. that's what they say.
it leads farther than that.
you can't find it in racing forms, chick.
only one thing to do, hank. drop the whole business quickly.
we tried!
his parents.
where?

no, m'sieu!
no... i just wanted to kiss you good- bye... you know too much 'bout little lula's mom...
what are you talking about?  you can't be serious.
perhaps the "jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  absolutely no practice necessary.  you shread like a giant. just press a button.
we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video, respectively. as such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
that's no reason. everybody wants to fly. my grandmother wants to fly. you going after a job with one of the airlines?

wait.  no.  you're kidding.  lights out? at nine?  my day's just starting.
nicky, i did -
you're pushing this too hard. it's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? you must know that's the way this is going, john? there's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
but i don't gamble, hilda!
if they are?
hello, grant. good to see you again.
because you asked him to, stupid.
what's with you guys?
i wish you a very good evening, mr. preysing. you are staying here, too, mr. preysing?
which one was that?
what did the name mean.  did you only read dead poets.
you are too cruel to da mayor, it isn't right.
well, i believe you have to fill out a form. there's a pad right around here.
her part in this i can't figure... but i will.
all hands. battle stations!
i don't know, what was the case?
what did you do that for?
i ate a guy last night.
oh, mom –– i'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
what's it about?
i guess i'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
shocking. did you know the government is wasteful?  you heard it here first. oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
don't let it get you down mrs. torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
are they worth reading?
please, i do not... i don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  but if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying dr. lechter's...
we'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
i wish it was.
i'll have your leg.
this is gonna make me puke. talk about something.
we started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
i'm here, sir, i just - i don't know how to feel about it.
she means it.
sleeping.
that's what i want to find out. we have to get help.
not at all. your highness, may i present madame yakushova?
your handwriting -- nothing more naked. see -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
of course!
leonard, dutton, erlich. they don't matter. i want the king.
hmm.  it seems you left something in our safe.
jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree.  tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
my wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. as you may have noticed.
tribuus, what happened in the arena? was narcissus killed?
he knows you, man. he knows all you want is to move up. that's all. a smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. but a guy like you? knowin' this is your only chance? waitin' eighteen years?
maybe after the holidays then.
no.  talk english.  then i'll understand.
if your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
oh, you see an analyst?
i want you to tell me a story, tin-tin.
yes, you do. you have to go rescue all those people...
do you want me to get someone?
frank?  i'm frightened.
you may be right.
...just some stuff.  a little of this, a little of that, that's all.
you're sure?
goodbye, dr. lecktor. you can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
yeah.
hey we're all friends, right? friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what jesse segundo is all about.
he checks too.
i stopped by the station a while ago.  i stared at the bus.  i could almost hear the kids inside.  there was a lawyer there.  he told me he'd gotten you signed up.  is that true?
what about the mob, dave?  how do they figure in this?
she'll never be the same.  none of us will.
...and i'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. we know i'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. and i know that you're a hooker. i hope you understand that i'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that i'm indifferent or that i don't care... i do... it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement. what i'm saying is... that i hope you understand that i understand.
grimes, you're dead!
there was nothing reckless in mrs. driscoll's behavior?
i never fucked up before, bobo.
somebody named leo crow.
have they proceeded with their experiments?
what if i say no.
shh.  mommy's here.  what is it?
yeah, what the hell, i'll go.
how're you doing--?
you mean he was colored?
i set those blocks together, patched the muscles. i put the nerves where they should be -- i did it and i did it right -- and she won't walk --
all too well, captain.
...maybe. i mean you gotta hide all the lights...
and when the fog lifted, there's darren with his head under justine's skirt.
she's my love...my life...love of it... in school when you're 12 years old. in school, in six grade....and i saw her and i didn't go to that school...but we met. and my friend knew her...i would say, "what's that girl?"  "how's that lily?" "oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  my friend would say this....but then sometime...i went to another school, you see? but then...when high school at the end, what's that?  what is that?  when you get to the end?
hello, george.  cigarette?
yeah. he's so cool and mysterious.
i know.  i watched it.  i sort of know it by heart.
some of them.
what?
yes. who's this?
yes...
was this supposed to be your room?
well, you're a little early...
the stratford.
thank you. thank you.
richmond is not all the way down south.
i'd love to argue with you sometimes.  but you're never here!
i was right! step on it!
kelly.  is suzie there?
pretty country.
uh, sort of nouveau deco... with a big vestibule. check it out next time you're up there.
what's there to do at the point? god, lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
three million.  i counted it twice.
i don't think so. their fix gave us the heads up and jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
eh, you were miserable this morning! we got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
i'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  did you get id off any of them?
they're all on microfiche. what year are you looking for?
the xk 101. luthor, that operates on radio waves. and with our fail-safe system, only the president himself can push that button.
two years ago, buddy.
it's just the strain again, the stress. we'll take a vacation.
what are you going to do?
yes, sir.
that is correct.
mrs. silvera?
you were trying to break down the door.  do you know why?
a group of us are going out tonight.
no, sir.
you're both full of secrets like macavity.  did you steal this?
what's next walt ?
right this very minute!  the porters are waiting for us on the plateau. and that chinaman thought he could stop me. come along.
forget it.  forget it.
look.
yes, albert?
what's the big idea, sefton? take that telescope out of here.
<u>i</u> dunno.... ambassador to <u>togo</u>, somethin', <u>i</u> dunno... he...
well, that i shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
yeah, right, duane-and over there is grammy hall, and that's sadie.
c'mon.  i don't want any jones about this.
my name is lenore oberfeld.
status report, admiral!
pleased to meet ya, jack. i read your book. i'm impressed. good work on curtis fox.
i feel the heat from your skin and the stubble on your chin you're no good
i'm dreaming.
you can't trace my holographic emitters, captainn. so don't bother. and you can't contact starfleet. we're quite alone.
we have to save the world.
do you like baseball?
she's definitely part of this.  it's weird, for a while ivy was all i could think about.  but then...
yes.
what are you worried about?  this job is going to last a long time.
that was quite a thing you did today.
you should have heard her play.
oh, no, harold.  he doesn't respond well to humor.  maybe if you talk to mother she can ...
whatever you say, man.  look ... can we talk about this?
i wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
where's dad?
oh baby... oh baby...
but now you can't go.
i love it.  she's got a hundred million bucks.  she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  and she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
he's trying.
you'll miss the battle of the century!
why would he take it?  he don't even know you.
you know what would be great?
if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel.  i will kill both him and the man who told me.
okay, troy!  let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
i'm afraid he's been stalling.
beauty? no. we're talking goddess.
wow. that's great. that's something to be proud of.
why don't you talk to levi off the record for a second?
howard, give him the keys...
oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
what do i -- ?  just a minute.
did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the law?
do you know much about icebergs, dad?
dinoine chagantakat!
five.
stop this nonsense! if you're in some sort of trouble i want to know about it.
here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. ring him up, he'll look after you.
who brought me in here?
now that's too bad.  i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
what is it?
mrs. semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
that's my good son: but where hast thou been
let me get it clear, veronica. you want yourself a sweet homeboy for this t.v. show so you can show everybody what a loose, martin luther cosby-lovng place westerburg is.
i didn't say a word.
he's clever? he had help?  oh.
agreed.
if i get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
i bet.  a lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
what is that?
want a cup?
he was a worker.  i danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. i'm not shocking you, am i?
okay, thanks.
kansas. who the hell do i know in kansas?
we're still drifting.
uh-oh!
perfect, she's using it.
the last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
the weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
i told you i don't know.
<b>and my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me i agree that there is now a battle to be won! something must be done!</b>
we're doing something -- ?
yes.
you want to drive?
forget it.
spock...
will you at least see how it fits?
well, look who's here...
oh, will! i'm sorry.
yeah.
how much do i owe you?
don't you open them anymore?
he's a wheel.  so's she.  it's hard to make friends with them.
miles? miles! where have you been? i've been trying to get in touch.
the chinese close in five minutes. beef lo mein. it's  been on my mind since i woke. whatjathink?
oh, thelma.  oh, no.
i thought you said you bought all that pudding --
why? she's a junkie.
altar boys?
y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the army sent.
how cold?
good evening, miss schmidt. you remember me?
thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
no i wouldn't. but i'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
not anymore.
game's over, eddie.
where?
first off... corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
i mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
you haven't heard my offer.
i'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. surely you would agree--
whew, i'm sure glad that's over.
her fucking head was caved in.
no.  i thought you had them.
have you got it? is it completed?
mrs. dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. he's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
the penguin house.
the generator!
there is one thing i'd like to understand... why do you want to go back, after all this?
they haven't been tough on me.  i just lost my money.  but when i compare these last ten years with the twenty i spent with him -
take my advice—grab the first bus back to miami. that guy's a phony.
right.  but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed... but not big billy.  he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  it came to the end of the game.  it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
damn! that must be about as far north as you can get.
...maybe i better forget it.
he became obsessed with her. she hated him. he had to have her. he kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. i'm not kidding. frank loved blue, blue velvet. he had to have dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
morning.
that's it! oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! you see what this tells us, huh? our killer doesn't love fire!
yeah let's hear about your day.
i'm sorry.
eh! love...what a mystery!  i understand you, toto...the ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  eh, there's nothing to be done about it! the heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. and if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
what's wrong?
sorry. what?
what did you hear?
i'll call you.
you're not going to shoot me, earl. i'm your friend, remember? i've got to write that story about your "production for use".
nothing, thank you.  nothing.  i wanted to see you...  what's mimi up to, charles?
i've heard of blue lou boyle.
what?
what is hitchhike?
i'm not saying i believe it...but i heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   they made a deal with the devil.  y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  and some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
well, home sweet home. i'll see you later.
this is matt hooper...
you knocked the fucking casket over, for chrissakes!
which is what?
no. i mean. well, actually, yes. sort of. i don't remember. listen, sara, i have to tell you something.
oh yes, i am.  not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
that's not so.
whatever you like.
i was only hoping to make you understand.
this is how you make dinosaurs?
so off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i didn't know it or something.  he got angrier and angrier and then:
hey buddy... let her go...
even so, i'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
anyway.  how much they offer you?
this is my room.
i realize you don't want to be involved.
i— i'd like to, edie, but—  —there's nothin' i can do. edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. she rises, and in a low voice says—
meet col --
they're all skanks.
put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
where do you hail from?
hello, natalie. mr. stewart smith . . . miss montgomery, mrs. eames, mrs. radcliff, mr. radcliff—
scar? never heard of any chief scar.
no, no, no, no, no.
no one-seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  he told me not to tell anybody, to bring claire and come alone!  he won't wait, he knows i'm two minutes away!  koontz, please!
a personal nature?
don't fall asleep.
tell me, knox. if you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
i'm not leaving without her.
everybody say, "bye, house."
we've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention?
i don't think that.
my blood?  i ... i gave at the office.
finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
i can't.
and how was your christmas?
they won't search you. i promise. you haven't done anything.
dad!
jesus.
that's great.
do you dream often?
it's not what you think.
what are you talking about?
why are you doing this?
ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. they do move in herds!
check out my ball.
don't forget these.
what id we run into someone i know?
no, clarence. just forget it, babe. i just wanna disappear from there.
tomorrow?
not a word.
why do you polish that thing all the time?
how's that?
you know those little dogs you see people with?
it is awfully hot down here. how do you manage to stay so cool?
...walk?
mom?  you okay?
a federal offense.
do i actually *see* this--?
i think i've found out about the money, sir.
look for names.  does it say whose taxes they are?
and what did you do?
why did you do it?
why don't you ask me?
two minutes.
oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. ever. you can tell me anything. i'll understand.
were you vacationing in los angeles?
cole and munoz.  i'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
of course.  the entire royal family will be there to honor you.
i appreciate it, but i don't accept it.
yes, admiral. but that may not be possible.
your mother was right. you do work too hard.
hey, sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
i'm not arguing.  i'm just telling you what the deal is--congresswoman.
coco leaves. you see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
i've been banished. in lieu of being fired.
i'm afraid not.  terribly sorry.
which is also why i've withheld this information from nato and our allies.
this is for me.
what do we have here?  a lovely new supply of venom.  i'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
george . . .
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... i don't think cochrane built this thing for comfort.
johnny, i'm sorry it had to be your unit on planet p. that mission had a very low survival probability...
it was you who got the standing o. it was you drawing on the belly over there...
you fainted last night after supper. the master and i carried you here.
'cause i'm just like dynamite.  and when i go off, somebody gets hurt.
well lose it! and why aren't you pushing the large sizes? didn't you get training about upsizing?
i don't have many friends.  dad's all the time moving.
let's go dancin', peanut. i'm ready.
tell me again -- what's my name?
sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, mr. franknum?
and all the time i've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. you should quit making waves.  go with the flow.
you got that right.
then she wasn't in the car.  <u>say</u> it.
they're right about you, aren't they?  you're fried.  you really don't know what's going on, do you?
how are you going to fight this?  maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  you'd have the good to weight against the bad! it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do!  gimme your shield.
let's go.
maybe it'll crush gaius.
&quot;in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
did she do that to you, too?
sure.  let's discuss betty mayfield.  how long since you saw her?
hello?  yeah, she is.  just a minute.  for you.
this is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  you're certain on mitchell?
well, i'm sorry, but i really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
vicky...last night...i wasn't lying.
well, what do you want me to do? stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that willet creek dam appropriation around my neck. either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or i'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
no joke, ma'am.  please open the door.
help me with this thing!
furnished?
marge, ripley's saying goodbye.
i don't get it.
-- good afternoon --
bad company...
but i'm not done with the machine --
anything you can tell me?
find her you dipshit!
typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. they like scaring people. that's why they call in their threats. same mentality as obscene phone callers.
hey where'd you go?
not so sure about that. letter of the law, you know. all the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
but i just wanted to say --
and i'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play!  plato never got a book advance...
yes.
these aren't half bad, fletcher.  you might have a second career coming.
buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. sid and breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
austin powers is getting too close. he must be neutralized. any suggestions?
what do you-?
we know all that we need to know --
let's talk ratings.  "truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that truman appears to have reconciled himself?
to begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
oh -- commander.  i didn't see you ...
who were you talking to?
not much, really.  caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |the first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
you're a cross-dresser.
what do i do.  i'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. an annoyance to my superiors. a joke among my peers. "spooky," they call me. spooky mulder. whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. that our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. that the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
what's next?
i'll match any man with the sword.
at home alone - where were you?
...oh, yeah, i bought the whole kit -- yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- i had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
i haven't been using it recently leslie
after all you've said... don't you know the part was written for margo?
are you from washington originally?
make the pizza.  i want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
with food?
and when might that be?
you'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
how'd you get to know so much about him?
the extras are in their places. now we need the star.  wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
is ray going?
-- the train for marseilles leaves at five o'clock. i'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
all right.  one -- two -- three -- four -- five. five hundred. be careful, honey.
naaaa. poor thing has a little dick.
"dear annie: thanks for your letter.  it was great.  we're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine's day and seeing if we are m.f.e.o. sleepless in seattle."
how did the rabbits kill him?
you kicked us off your turf, merk. don't rain on our parade.
-- i've been here before! -- on my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
but we had heat baby. passion! fire! we owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  at least one more time.
in a second.
where's doug?
oh.  i'd forgotten.
who said this was murder?
my change.
i'm not going!
he's nothing. he's in my acting class. but he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named lee donowitz. i thought donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. he could use it. he could afford it.
he got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  it was right after the pulse so all the dmv records were wiped.  so we don't get anything on the seller.  except i actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... say thank you.
i'll send you straight to hell, fuck!
everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
yes, well...  famished.
well, are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke.
where did you disappear to?
so you eat-- read it everyday?
i think so.
how are you feeling today?
no -- the rent in paid. the lady asked us to promise, i wouldn't open the door.
i'll give you fifty cents.
i'm sorry man, i shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. this whole week's just been crazy. i've had my head up my ass the entire time.
you don't?
you look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
theo, buzz is dead.
this is it.
what?
whaddaya got, nolan?
er... well... we... we... would be terribly grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
what are we talking about here?
that's what i asked.
goodbye, muffin.
i've worn this mask so long, i couldn't sleep without it.
well... you see, when i broke it off with phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
and you, do you believe?
i'm sorry.  i know i heard noises... the detective's wife...
you are now in h.m. prison parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! name?
if i look weak now, it's over.
wait, erik!
where did it come from?
yeah, like the bird.
town police.
--without  the means  for higher education, so mr. lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
where you goin'?
everyone. working overtime. just for you.
oh, my! 
i'm so tired i'm about to drive off the road.  keep me awake, willya?
i saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
let's see...do you know her cup size?
nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
what happened? is there a problem?
on the bar t... looking for... them.
oh, no. i wouldn't go ...
jeez, man. but you're good at it!
oh, sure, sure. but first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in reno -- meanwhile, i'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
because, i don't know, because sometimes...sometimes i forget things...and ever since caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...i fainted and...  why is this so hard?
you gave me a 'd'.
yeah, but whose point of view?
i thought maybe you did. i know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
no, please, i don't --
it is insane.
all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt! she apologized, didn't she?
oh, yes.  it would probably kill him.
you'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
i don't need a lecture on ethics, jim, okay?  i know what --
<u>so what are we doing</u>?
what is it that i can't figure?
the point of fedex, as i understand it, is to make the damn connection.
then why are you doing it?
no!  don't kill him!  pendergast, you were right.  it's john!
what i wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
so. what then? you just detach sex from everything..
you don't have to sing it.
are you sure?...  about me, i mean?
you really look awful.
i'm glad things have worked out for you.
i wouldn't say that.  careless, maybe.
tell me about catherine.
i'm leaving! i...am...leaving!
yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
she's murdered her hair... you do something with her, i'm never going to touch her again.
too low.
goddamnit walter!  you fucking asshole!
avery said she was tight with his daughter.
the people. when they pay him homage, he adores them. but when they have the ... audacity to question him. to doubt him. to embarrass him. then he despises them.
you're not giving up, are you, mr. dickson?
you want to know what i think?
good for you.
never. i swear to god he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. he's always working on 10.
tell me something, skid --
i don't know...to get al.
i've no choice
here you go, pete.
yeah. it's not just the chip, it has a pci bus. but you knew that.
what's a concubine?
carter, there's something i have to tell you.  you were right about what you said in hong kong.  all i do is work.  never take a day off.  it's all i have right now.
what belongs to the people?
boo! ah, ha ha. ooh. boo! ha ha ha.

it works, poppy.  it works, it works!
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
what if he checks it?
we are?
what's that? a hundred?
it's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
jamie, what happened?
and that's why you never went pro?
which of you did it? which of you made me the way i am?
then you know why i have to face him.
what happened?
c'mon, forsythe. are there any more on the list?
it's holding... she's holding...!
what of my soul? do i have one? or was that a part you left out?  who were these people of which i am comprised? good people? bad people?
yes.
whoee, it's cold. wisht i had somethin' to eat. bread, grits, beans even. soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then i'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  now we can't take every nazi in this country to trial, although i would like to; it's an impossibility. so we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
and when i try to talk to you seriously, when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
funny you should say that. my grandfather was a peach farmer.
none of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! you stuck bruce baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! now, give me that wallet or i'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! it'll be for life!
you and lois, you get all the action.  there she is, out in the wild west and everything.
you gotta be kidding me.
that oughta do it.
it's none of my business what you write. and your job, that's none of my business either. i love you. and i've done everything wrong.
when i get the scotch, how do i know you won't take off?
sure you can. come on.
and i actually date you?
you're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
i don't know.
pardon?
today.
di, we're sorry.  we...
you'd like me better that way, jimmy?
how do you know there is a grand hotel?
-- viktor, are you with her?  is she there?
jack, she's a fucking waitress in buellton. how would that ever work?
why are you here?  hmmmmmmmm!!!! ok.
yes, i can.
if you want a partner, i think you should recalculate the split.
soon. how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
we already made the same offer to the stockholders.
you paying attention?  this oughta hurt like hell.
i'm third in my class.
okay, sir...but where's the cover?
brother, when i have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  and you weren't reading huckleberry finn. i looked and its not in your room. now what were you doing?
good for you.
i'm needing lunch.
you okay, jim? how do you feel?
or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
does it tell me how to get laid?
nothing.  but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
well... yes, quite possibly.
with the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
were you at the inquest?
get married. have a wedding.
come on, man.  what else could it be?
i got a lot of people work for me, lilly. i can't have shit like this.
you know, i never saw you in your uniform before.
how 'bout the sheriff?
but you would not stay with me.
i guess we've never been introduced proper. jake mckenna.
look, she walked out on her own child, right?  that's desertion, right? mr. shaunessy, i'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
but you're going skiing with us yankees, aren't you?
where's ma?
okay.  good afternoon.  goodbye.
why?
it becomes an addiction.
oh, uptown. you know. some joint. it ain't much.
are you talking to me?
you what? what are you on about?
no, i don't.
huh... i guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... i’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
that's a chance i gotta take.
watch this!
do you know where she might be?
i can't find him.
they're naturally wary, ma'am. we've been at war a long time.
you know, i've thought about that, actually.
do you always say 'no' to everything?
i screwed up twice, sir.
yeah, well, oh boy, listen, i've got to go. thank you, uh... victoria?
seventy-five per cent.
i know my time's up, but i've got to get this out while i've got hold of it --
i'll be asking the questions.  last night, you hear anything unusual? screams? shouts?
does it make you happy?
you're here... i'm a bit surprised.
right.  right.  you think it's the wrong moment.  fair enough.  do you mind if i have a go?
well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  they believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
well... what happened?
i feel sick.
anywhere.
okay, so do you see a door marked "core unit?" should be down at the far end to your left.
it's enough isn't it?
one of us pays the other for half.
thank you.  when debby...
stay out of this. or lachez - moi or t'agueue
because i know you. you prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
you're fast.
no ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.

i'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
yep, there they are... they always look the same every year...
what else, stupid! you don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  ten thousand bucks? chicken feed! we're holding her for a million smackers.
wrong!  you haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
oh say -- elaine gets down from berkeley on saturday.

the movie star?
i do, too!
it's you they're after, madmarti- gan.  what did you do this time?
damn.  damn!  if i could just get chris to read this poem!
you come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  this was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  i can't leave.  you can stay with me, and believe me, i want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, i can't do it.  and you shouldn't either.
how'd you know it was me?
sir, i got taipei grindin' on me here. how long is this supposed to ta--?
your brother?
set him up.
you have to help me
my equations are not parlor-tricks!
now you know how it feels.  to be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.

but, what if i go into labor? that could happen any time.
me a cop? what made you think that, mr. brandon?
only myself and two other girls. one is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
not that it matters.  this is the morgue?
yeah?!
a girl?
i'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when i left.
my brother blacksmiths!

shut up!  not another word out of you!  you're going down, the feds know all about it!  you didn't know some of it was marked, did you! where's the rest?
it was you, galbraith!
oh my god, i got the most fucked up thing i been meanin' to tell you.
what shall we do?
don't know if it'll do any good, mr. cuthbert.
i know you! what can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "who goes with the mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
that's probably my office.

paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.

he already knows everything about what he can't do.  you can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
where the hell did you come from?
intimately. for every sin you have placed on my head i could give you a hundred others. i have been swimming in blood my entire life. but i retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but i believe that private lives should not be public property.
can we talk?  just for a minute?
no further questions.
the football stud?
it's john, isn't it?
why? why not? you know these kids from when you went to school here. it hasn't been that long.

she didn't do anything. she took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'k.c.'  'kathy costello...'
what are you looking for, colonel?  what's your name?
cinderella man! that's sensational, babe! sensational!

i'm telling you, they changed it!
okay.  these are good.
i'm... i'm alright.
it's not your roof anymore.
the carbon-units infection will now be removed from the creator's planet.

"do what you can"?! that's not good enough i

it may not have been an accident. they never did find her head...
mother?

then what goes on in there?  what i mean is, what are you thinking about?
what about legitimate businesses? we own a construction concern, real estate --
the one with the ax?
you played it for her and you can play it for me.
name's otis.
viznick will get off and michael's got a crush on you.
i know where he is.
obviously, this can't last.  she's going to dump him.  viktor won't be able to take that.  he's too sensitive.  it'll destroy him.
just for the operation in paris. i need to be married.  they'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
dartmouth
oh, mr. denby, i wrote a poem about a bracelet--
i'm sorry about this, mr. wyatt. i didn't know you had a daughter.
i was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...i'll take a kiss.
hello, mr crane.
i'm afraid that's not so, sir.
this attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?

they'd never sail this close to the shore.
umm. well. yes. but no more strange voices in the night, rose.
agent starling! telephone!

that's not bad at all.

captain?

you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
aren't we waiting for ricky?
in the tar??
accused. not indicted. he resigned the firm. divorced nineteen seventy. galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. since then he's been on his own. four cases before the circuit court. he lost them all. he drinks.
6... 5...

where's my bed?
dr. lester, i have a question. i was in that vacant office down the hall and i stumbled upon a little door and....
this has got to be one big violation...
i think that we should spend some time apart.
what's this about?  because we <u>fought</u>?
i...
it's my field. i represent athletes. i'm an agent.
that's okay.  i understand.
kay connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
yes.
but she's dead!
no one else that i know?
we think he might be making a reference to drugs?  miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine.
what should i be, a white inferior- ist? a multicultural zulu egalitarian? let me ask, where are your people from?
yeah, guy?
saw your movie the other night. watched it with some friends.
you afraid of violence?
hell of a show.  hell of a job, stan.
goes up.
what do you mean?
i am.
your mother called.  you shouldn't upset her like that.
no, you do, cowboy. you been to the bar?
would you have shot if it was a man?
don't do that again.
what do you want, shithead?
didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  maybe they have a telephone i might use.
they sell fake memories.
i will order a mass for his soul. it will guarantee his place in heaven.
who are you?
my purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
in time, she will.
--i'm not angry at you--
how?
i think i should spend the night here.
then they do need me, don't they. they really need me...
i'll tell you what. let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
what time is it?
oh, sorry.  with the light always on, it's hard to tell.
gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown laplante!  she let channel eight get a beat on us.
now hold on! we should hear her out!
who else is paying for all this? you badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
i see.
good! first shot!
alright, i'll talk to her
i knew you'd come back.
when can i see, you again ?
make it twenty.
no.  i don't scare easy.
magic potion.  you should try a little.
i'm a solid man.
she thought you were money.
'eh, chief?
you must be exhausted.
hey.
keep the change.
you know, amy, i've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... i mean, is this what i get first thing?  before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
you think he killed edmunds?
why not?
depends if my date wants to stop by.
i... i... think i'm... shot.
something like that?
that's fun!  let's race for some- thing!
and i thought you were only after my body.
sleep with me and the secrets of the west are yours.
yeah.
was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
i've never weighed 135 lbs.!
standing right here in my office.
what do you mean all of a sudden? you've been going with her six months.
i will ride with sir kay. lancelot, rest here.
it's that gardener!
well, even if i'm not the wolfman, i am crazy enough to do something like that. i mean, here i sit in leicester square talking to a corpse. i'm glad to see you, jack.
he is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
big mess every time.
give him the tape.  see?  it's fucking brilliant!  the tape for faith.  i know he'll go for it.  i can set it up.
why do hate the grey hair, magua?
whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  the kid comes in at six will wake ya.  a couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
right.  what do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
no way. i'm about to blow up.
he could be working her to get to you.
what?!
drugs judge, they're gonna flood west oakland with dope. jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. and while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every panther they can find.
you don't know?
is this with a girl named kristen?
i had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
i'll be right back.
the unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
got divorced, i wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. the fellas down here said they'd back me--
i'm sorry, doctor.  georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
lucy.
you can be goddamn sure, though, i'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when i get back to baltimore--i get proof who stole my shit and i call the cops!
one is all?
hello bill.
praise jesus.
i got an award once. from the mayor.
he wanted me to kill him, but i didn't.  he did it himself.
did you warn her?
that's enough.
the damn thing is going to have our asses....
yes, and stop repeating everything i say, and turning it into a question. spooning, fooling around, god knows what.  you arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, i still don't under- stand --
i can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
i guess... if i'm going to be dead, i'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
i knew it, <u>he</u> started it, i should have known.
no, lemme finish.  i don't like this job!  that boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  and susan, like you said, she's growing up.  two heads. what i mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
before they leave, get gold.
captain, the press knows the size of titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. we must give them something new to print. and the maiden voyage of titanic must make headlines!
what is it?
what's the matter?
who's been talking to you? the army? have they been talking to you, huh?
no, not nothing.  what's wrong with the righteous brothers?
then what you telling me to study in them for?
i take care of the being-fair-to-me department. things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
right.  well.
did he speak?
working hard?
but--
where did you learn how to do that?
of course it's true - and he knows it.
mr. gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. these staff meetings, they just go on and on.
he's well-trained.  he'll behave himself.
because of kennedy?  are the same people gonna kill us, daddy?
what did he look like?
he's convulsing!
what?
--a spy, you mean?
how much would i get paid?
and we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
we feel great, don't we? just <great>?!
i don't know! everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  serious!
i mean, i don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
if you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
i'm joe galvin, i'm representing deborah ann kaye, case against st. catherine laboure.
c'mon, luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
first. it's our first. i'm just concerned. so... why are you killing yourself?
alright.  that's a justifiable homicide.
so you were stealing their honey. they should have killed you.
ellie, you know i think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  we can afford it now.
finder's fee?
they told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
well, we...
no, mama, i'm in mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to argentina!
she is, mama...  when the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
a book on the warehouse murders?
here you are, sir. 
i need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
i came for paul as well.
you wanted the truth -- now you have it.
is anything wrong?
take me home.
he's replaying the game i played against him move by move, using these girls as the chess pieces.  all the girls have been found in their homes except christie eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  why?
if you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
i'm not sure i have anything to drink... there might be some --
y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. i told you to stay beside me.
no what?
hi.
they're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
what?
how do i even know which one has it?
cash or check? for the cabin...
there's this poem by rilke, i don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  about waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  and the last line of it goes, "who knows?  perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
no, really.
yes, i want to kill you! i hate your fuckin' guts!
this scene is why i'm doing the movie. "look at the mill, frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
you were well adjusted to my being dead?
possibly.  just to spite dehaven.
i have a confession to make. i'm not real big on flying.
is miss simone coming today?
there's nothing in it!
you're late. very late.
good morning.
yes! back! back! listen - don't you know where you are?
why do you keep doing this?
the case..with the stones... where is it?
well, that about covers everything.
why, max? it's a good name for you. max, you see conspiracies in everything.
we can still see each other.  just like always.  it's a different kind of sin. smaller.
how much?
you must come with me.  it's much too late already.  you must come with me to the graveyard.
we need to do some tests...i'd like to ask you a few questions.
you're like new york. you're an island.
i notice these things are back in fashion.  oh, honey.  he's a lovely man, annie.
it's in all the afternoon papers. i'm very sorry.
what?
tore up from the floor up?
it's my daughter, man.  i know i never told you about her, but god, i love that girl.  she calls herself zuzu petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is l.a. a fucking groupie partying with the pros.  you have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
i don't think it matters.  last nights victim, christie eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. the night before, debi rutlege was found in the center.
test of manhood.
how was it...?
on the baltimore and ohio.
fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
you all right, pop?  you want me to drive you?
do you know why you didn't make it?
verdado.

whoa, thanks for stopping. i been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
just tell me, did you talk with him?
well, i'd best be off.
where'd he go?
you know what he's really upset about?
i believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
how about another beer?
that's right, yeah.
relationships are a bitch, here. it's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. having a woman here is asking for it.
i don't know... please... tell me i'm dead...
right. seven.  christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
very nice.
[do you know who i am? i am the commandante of the judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
jesus... maybe white's not so dumb after all.
wait, did you say wife?...are you fuckin' married!!?
there was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "journey's end".  every experienced director turned it down, so i offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "journey's end" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  it was only a matter of time until hollywood beckoned.
no way! he just called him a dick.
yes.  i'm here to tell you that i've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical.
he's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
amanda, honey! dr. grant says it's a bad idea!
thank you.
here it is, bruce. one -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
you find the source?
the blood transfusion continues. marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. nikolas watches léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. marc keeps a close watch on nikolas, who grows paler and paler. his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again.
yeah. drexl had an association with a fella named blue lou boyle. name mean anything to you?
we've done... very well. you know anything about addiction, doc?
i could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
there's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. how many beaks have they got between them?
what did she tell you?
who said?
and what lesson have we learned from all of this, babe br... sam... i mean samuel?
that sounds great!
what do you mean?
how do you know i'm innocent?
guess i don't have to worry about him anymore.
no, we don't talk. i don't make bad bets. seventy-five, twenty-five. that's it.
you aren't staying?
what size?
perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them.
<u>did</u> you want to be killed by it?
so why are you asking me?
it would be a nice change from you.
feel anything?
to an asian design major.
hey, i'm a child of divorce. give me a break  hmmm, i see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
could i get another room.
is it?
you go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
how do we look?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns, harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   then mr. stearns, he tried to fix a case.
your mom got pregnant and i had to make choices.  you don't have a choice.
all you got to do is lay down an' watch.
will it change my life?
do you think you'll find her?
rufus, play it back...
when i told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  that was just smoke, starling, i had to get rid of him. you did well in there.
compassion.
how come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause i don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  by the way, bobby rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
you know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned. a beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
you lied to me
i think it's badly scarred too. from a motorcycle accident.
they're letting me have this vacation. which is why the get-up. which is why you haven't heard from me.
and that hard-on, salvy. who's he think he is? i'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
i *know* this was right.
beth shalom. like you wanted.
i told you i should've cuffed him.
there have been a number of reports in reputable news media - time, newsweek, our own nbc - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  what is your response?
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  his parents are at his bedside.  fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television's taxi"...
divine intervention.
how'd you get in here.
we have to try it.  we can't stay here.  melanie needs help.  mother, the house won't take another attack.
no, sheriff, i'm just--
willard...
how'd you get a tux at the last minute?
the mantan manifesto.  catchy ain't it?  number one.  we gainfully employ african americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  two. let the audience decide.  three. who put these critics in charge? these so-called cultural police? four.  who determines what is black? five.  mantan is a satire.  six. if they can't take a joke, "f" 'em.
yeah? why?
new york? you're not the company president by any chance?
hello, this is back.
she likes <u>both</u> of us.  we both helped her out.
it's a lotta dough. if i was to run across that dame, you know what i'd do?

they sure must have been travelin'. this keeps up we can start a store.
i hear your show was sold out already. there's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
did you sleep well?
what's happened?
i gotta say, erin -- first time i saw you, i did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
i was going to fix you breakfast.
you're ready to move up. christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. may as well get paid instead of punished.
shall we be all right?
i'm a puppeteer.
it's gotta be the next one. i mean it's gotta be! right, albert?
that the word on our boy?
they'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in brookhaven.  usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
and no people.
i hear you.
it's too soon to move him.
here come six more... grid two!
please. you're in danger.
they seemed to be plausible this time. a general strike is a good argument for the un.
your a good guy chris you deserve a nice girl.
next christmas. is he santa claus who has left a present for dorothy? what was it? an ear? another ear?!!  what was it?

pamela isley.  i was so attracted to her i couldn't reason clearly.  i still can't.  she used to work for wayne enterprises.  find a file.
charenton? the administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
and if english law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the french!
he'll probably kick me right down the stairs. i only hope he does.
you might talk too much.
no...
what?
no, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
i'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
personally, i'm type o.
you're an imbecile.
eugene.  admit it, peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "flash."
[beat] you don't believe me, do you?
the baron is a frightful man.  they say he's an ogre.  he wears a mask so none may see his face.

poor man.  and, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
i am <u>not</u>!  beetle... juice?
really?
you gotta be kidding?  he's a human chum line!
i usually don't either.
or shitty!!  otis!!
i don't know what the fuck you are.
do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  i want to go home.
you mean you had a bad dream.
look, larry. . . have you ever heard of vietnam?
rather be back in the mountain?
he needs me, ma'am.
clemenza promised rosato three territories in the bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
and don't start crying.
i'll look for 'em.  how you doing?
because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come i know.
and she's in your house.
i'm not a traitor. i've served my ountry.
only because you want it.
that it's not over yet.
i guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
my own undercover feature - "written by josie geller".
but the rest of it?  the killing headaches.  the phantom smells.  my inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. it's all nothing more than bad electricity?
that's the front up the road a few miles. we have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
no. cambridge. harvard. my family's in tuxedo, new york, though.
mrs. kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
you're gonna offer to set him up?
so, she didn't leave a note?  she never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
great move. great
i can't hold on much longer!
what's your name?
they castrated him. he can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
what is it?
i want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
it's nonsense.
what you just said. say it again.
no, not, not everything. this. i am the man in your life.
you're right, i don't understand. explain it to me.  you were scared. arlyn page, that scared you. well it should; that's death. so what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. ligourin kills women.
then why do you stay?
how is he?
do it.
jesus christ!  and you never told me?
ok. 
i really want to catch up with you, but i've gotta take this call. they're holding. i'll talk with you when you get back in town. bye.
turn up the fucking music! my heart feels like an alligator! volume! clarity! bass! we must have bass! what's wrong with us? are you goddamn old ladies?
it's wednesday night.  she's at my house.  i'll talk to her.
nothing sticks to slime, emily.  this should cover what you lent me.
i do, sir.
title's the first thing's got to go. and the guy's name. i mean, even this writer's name, murray saffrin is better than "lovejoy".
it's not worth it, tom. he's surrendering.
donna was a girl i knew in florida.
do we have to?
hey, nick. vien acca. [italian- american slang for 'come here']
you must think i'm terrible, hanna.
we're stuck with this...
in that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass i'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
i'll get it.
... and we work my hours.  i'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. you gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
what have you done to me? you've condemned me to hell.
is this real?
i got my wish anyway.
i miss you.
cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
are you matthew parker ?
no, can't think of anything else that matters.
tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid.
then we'll open it in detroit or dallas or kalamazoo for god's sake! we'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
doug i can't, i've got to be at work by eight. you promised to take me home.
maybe you should take that coffee outside.
grandma death will teach me how. soon.
how much do you need?
don't ask.
uh, well, what'd she say? is pony coming?
about you and jill and needing a third person. she went back to lillian?
what do you think?
what does that mean?
i need this, roy. i can't run without money, and if i can't run i'm dead.
i like them.  i was sick of looking at this room.  i think they add a little life.
who put you up to this? did my ex- wife ask you to...?
where's taylor?
sometimes which?
isn't that awful? poor brenda frazier. poor little gloria. they ruined them! they ate them alive!
it's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... it wasn't that i really liked marco more.  in fact i thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  it was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what i mean.  your self-image started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange.  and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and marco seemed a bit more, i don't know, glamorous? more sure of himself?  less hard work, because i felt like i was dragging you around, sort of.  a little sunnier.  sparkier.  i don't know.  you know what people are like at that age.  they make very superficial judgements.  do you think that's superficial?  he was a clown, if it's any consolation.
why are you carrying the dog?
you don't know that.  even i cannot see their fate.
good-bye, dil
claire.  pleased to meet you.
-- 73
oh, i can't stand it.
i don't care. i'll wait.
nothing. are you alright?
and i've got good news for you, baxter. all your troubles are over.
is jeff hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim chief of police in your absence?
i'm sorry...
it looks fine.
i do what i'm told.
it could be a purely impersonal thing. what matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
no. that's not possible! if we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
paramus... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably program assist routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
i'm a very sick girl.
i always favored the hulk.
if you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  don't you see?  if you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
what're you doing here?
the way you were looking at me, i just went.
never to put you in my will.
ah, jesus...
you haven't finished your beer.
i think you did it.
why are they ganging up against me?
what do you think i am -- a crook?
it won't work --
i don't know.
oh, come on! this is such bullshit! the work is getting done, david. lucky keeps me on top of everything.
yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you i'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. it stands to reason, i won't have it.
what's all that gunfire?
i told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. if something good doesn't come of gage's death, i think i'll go crazy.
oh, i can't be the cause of anything between you and hannah.  i jus--
master bath.
something i heard someone say once.
...don't you?
so that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
well, i would like to sit in front today.
can i help you look for the space man? can i?  i know what he looks like! he's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
sense/net taped a full spectrum personality construct on mccoy six months before his death. everything dixie was -- everything dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of sense/net's.
what happened?
what's hinckley cold storage?
hello, helen!
i have the power to build a time machine.
you look like robinson after that last lamotta fight.  'course lamotta looked a lot worse.  so you're twenty-two, right?
i have no intention whatsoever of hinting. your sister, mary, is a murderess. she killed irving august -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
in that camper out there i saw a guitar. i take it that's yours.
...forty thousand dollars!
harvard? whoa, daddy!
well... don't you think it's up to me to...
why are you creeping around delia's bedroom?
naturally.
what do you think he's doing?
i was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  sleeping arrangements.
"cotton".
this is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
two-hundred.
was that lincoln james i seen run off?
pop.  i'm sorry.
i know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. get that money over here and i'll stop this run within five minutes.
i can't. i have to stay with my patient.
you were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
we will.

little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  this dick trying to bushwack me.
good night, sir.
mom, i was there, and i just, i was so... they didn't have the olives, and i, i got so upset. i don't know how it happened.
you should look into private schools.
near freedom falls.  she went for help.
he's better dead. i know he was mixed up - but not like that.
tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
yeah. i can imagine.
you're not going to let it go, are you?
all right! shut up a second and i'll tell you! jesus! i didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
we should have asked for cabin one... the one mary was in.
it's just like driving a car....
what does that mean?
why did he come back for you?
sure.
and we're glad to have you here...
you've been over the line and you came back.  you've been saved, hallelujah!
evelyn, right?
oh, thomas. ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. i been there a hundred times. loaded with tomatoes. boy, you're funny, ma.
what are you going you doing?
...ed?
what do they do up there?
as long as it's on their terms. if your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.

gotta eat a breakfast, marge.  i'll fix ya some eggs.
she took the baby in her arms?
you hungry, son?

and if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. she's opposed to my career.
jennifer. a severed arm. it's bloody and... i'm not sure but it may be carlton's.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
fill her up?
yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, cooper?
because i don't want one.
how'd it go at the trade show? you make all the other salesmen jealous?
schwartz.
i looked everywhere, honey, but all i could find was your hat.
have you ever had one do this?
well, i'm here.  so, is that my problem? i'm afraid of being abandoned? that was easy.
as we near the pole...
hello.
huh?
good morning, my lord!
you saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
tonight.
the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? what are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. one thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
what are you talking about?
you ok about that?
didn't you have no inkling?
dr. paley, where were you the last time you saw miss lawson?
i wouldn't know.
she told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! can you believe it?!
you stupid, little man! how could you have let this happen?! i gave you my soul and now you're going to sell it!?
i mean we can still... whatever... maybe i should get a towel?

dead and gone.
general, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. the thought of any of my children going hungry...  who's the cutest widdle worker?  you are!  yes, you!  don't forget to brush your teeth!  ship 'er out.  what steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  we're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
why not? the future of our race runs through your bloodstream. you've got the best of both worlds, blade. all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
what'd he look like?
i'm trying to tell you.
the only chick more untouchable than christy malone is miss april.  "hi, my name's ginger. i love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." here's a tip:  set it on vibrate, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  don't knock it till you tried it.
sorry.
could i see some identification, sir?
i said that?  which word was "goat?"
but then you knew what he was like all along... maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on...
hey, you're good! i bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
come on, sid. give me the gun.
we can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
morpheus, i don't think this is a good idea.
i know, uncle, you've told me that already.
yeah.  first communion.  aren't i a little angel?
and i'm an old hand at following instructions--
you're a comedian?
and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "he only had two more russian words right than wrong."  ha!  that's like me saying touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
not anymore you don't.  doll.
stop, stop... i can't remember!  the battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... i was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself...
mr. barboni is a good customer.  works for jimmy capp.
places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. but you don't have to understand. i do. so no talking.
the truth is, i haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
looks like he missed ya.
ligourin: how could you do it?
perhaps some tea?
they made me put my hat back on.
"dad says we gwan sleep on it.
oh sure they try. the idea of a better life.  but they don't really know much about life: they get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. the trick. the trick. men in bed. not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. just the trick, the transaction.
there's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
you mean we're alone on the boat?
dad, i'm sorry....
mother, i ...
no!  look at you!  you're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
my, that fudge smells yummy!
yummy. carl says if i lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the university of maryland fall mixer.
i just want you there in case there's trouble.

that's a hell of a swing you got there, noel. i'm thinking strawberry in his prime.
i am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in washington.
you know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. that's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
now i'm gonna puke.
and that was the end of it?
what are we having?
interview over, blattis ...
how many times have you gone unprotected?
who are you?
wait! hell!..something's wrong!
i thought you were going to dinner.
that's impossible.  you heard echoes ...echoes.  we have three bullets and three shots which came from the book depository and that's all we're willing to say.
you can't kill me, star.
how dare you. you're disgusting and evil.
no. is that what you want?
wildman's in town. he just became an american citizen. something big's about to go down. i want to know where he goes and who he sees. i want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
i'm not an agent, mrs. lampert -- i'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
for what.
that's what we need here, satch.  a lucky break.
oh ny god... oh my god... oh my god...
isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?

you see, madam, i am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
patronizing you... nay, i love you.
mr. scott, how soon can we get underway?
it's not sucking, sir.
you know, we're getting married.
i took it once for a low thyroid condition...  it raises the metabolism, lou.  did david ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
you're kidding, right?
and the flowers... let's not pick them. they're so nice.
why's that?
how's the trout?
lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
can you feel it, poppy?  the presence of the moment?  can you feel the weight of its significance?
pleasant surprise.
i just realized this is for television, isn't it?  i can't swear up and down like i just did.
london?
it's not a real picture, stacy, it's been doctored-up.
that little place just two hours form new york. it's on my list of things-i'll-never-understand. like collecting shrunken indian heads...
it's a smelting retort.
you shit.  who do you think you are?
well, well. small world, isn't it?
alright...i'm shooting for a nine o'clock eta.  beer in hand by five after.
i'll get the car.
what?
i'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
i don't buy it. it doesn't make sense.
life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. you must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. you gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but i -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
i know the cruelty of such a fate.
i'm glad you're around to say it.
ted, i'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. now i want you to level with me: did you knock this skirt up?
look. i'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. but you're only eighteen. we can still turn it around.
is she?
you wanted to warn me...
i got an audition, i won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, i'll see you later. love you.

the man and the woman are married --
bank teller's just a start. i got plans. real plans. not opening some zoom-boom room. this time next year i'll be a loan officer.

how heroic of you...

it's called "the philosophy of time travel".
it seems i've found a flaw, john  you.
i don't know what you're talking about.
danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
listen! maybe we won't get to hy- brasil! maybe we won't find the horn resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.

will shakespeare!
i trained in the east, myself -- cornell -- and i don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... did you?
mm.

i'm sorry about --
i think we were wrong about tex having the money.
elliot blitzer.
we pick up ordell. we've got three murders we can link him to. we have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. and we have you.

i think i’d rather have drugs.
"mitch?"
and -- and --
are you finished here, sebastian?
i don't like this.

holy shit...
i think thomas pynchon's a genius.
it used to be serious -- at least i was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
i've read about the museum's financial troubles.
can you fly this airplane and land it?
and we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and i'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place so we set t-t-traps everywhere. and every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!

nobody's fuckin talking to you.
you know, i think it's a little late for that.  do give my regards to gradski if you see him.
garrison...?  then the president was right.  except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard rebels trying to make the south rise again.
it's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.

madame pomponi is on the telephone, sir.

nick. i'm so scared. i'm so fuckin' scared to go home.

yeah.
will - uh - five thousand be enough?
frida? i was worried to death about you. i've called you for two days. where have you been?
very well.  but, it will only sit gathering dust.
you look like you're far away. far away and thinking about other things. i'm right about that, aren't i?
apropos of nothing... so. so so so so --
i have some very good memories there.
you're leading again.
i sure don't hate you.
i don't want to.  don't need to.  i love you.
sure you do.
whose word?
bullshit! you're just as much a part of it as they are!
you are too gracious. these things have some merit, i suspect ... but this--  ... i am convinced, is fine. 
and you listen to that?
kind of feeling your oats this morning. i haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
cheerleading.  for... sporting events, yes?
i think so.  if she didn't she should have.  i've only got maybe an hour.  then volleyball practice is over and i have to be home.
parachute.
i don't know what kind of game you're playing here but i'm out because you are a whack-job.

that's what you believe she is?  the sum of her psychological parts?
yep.  so how's annie?
no?
and you don't?
i was never built for these moonlight strolls.  why did we have to leave the bus?
you, i would've noticed.
flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  do you appreciate flowers?
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
no.
oh, yes, i forgot: it's your occupation, isn't it?
so who's the guy?
so what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? we got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
i should have vito go with you all the time.
it will end tonight.
chess. chess is often used as well.
about time they started cleaning up the trash downtown.  we don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
i worry because you don't.  it's my job. i'm feeling guilty.  i would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
not if you remember my dad.
i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
fifteen.
well, i believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. especially when the moon's out.
i do not want your power. it is hideous.
oh yeah.
there you are!  man, i don't know how to thank...
no, thelma, i don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  i may not even make it home for dinner.  you know how fridays are.
any of your passengers want a place to sleep—there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
yeah, my luck.  i get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
right back at the start, right?
come on, dignan.
you can't double-cross me like that.  you were to help me. you were to operate on him. you were going to put him under my power.
blaine, if i knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
[lot of] how many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
it's my condition. i never know if i've already eaten, so i always just eat small amounts.
yes...
after all this time i'd think you'd know me better, meyer.
he's trying to stop us waking the gods.
good. that's good. then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
shit.
great.  buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee mwaaaaaa. . . . .mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. maxine?
why?
what do those ghosts want when they talk to you? think real careful now, cole...
pardon me, was that mr. chance?
you've made a wonderful impression. your views are liberal... it is easy to see you have an open mind.
huh?
and what?
it's a homeless shelter.
only squares and nerds go to dances.
your line, george!
ben!  what's wrong?
then how do you know he sells guns?
why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
is it night or day, erik?
true, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  we can keep him contained. it's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
why?
well, see, i was talking to mr. mcallister about my leg and everything... and how i still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
what happend to you?
we're not saying anything about that night to the police. we should all forget that night.
so, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
you live like a pig.
the same day she supposedly went down.
stop it.
fucking.
aunt may, you're trespassing.
how does the distress signal look?
don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
no way!  i'd cramp his style.  and i wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  i'm way to unattached for that.
i can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
what do you mean?  didn't you come back here for it?
had to.  to keep him still for the trip.
when i walked out, i waited ten minutes outside your door. ten. waiting for you to come find me.
thank you, bobby.
it's deputy riley today, sid.
what's beyond this place -- do you know?
you hear my okay?
no ... there is another.
i'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
the stones will be here. i'll see to it personally!
how about ann? is she going with you?
will he show mercy to my country? will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
none of your business.  god.
really.  with the porch swing and everything...
yeah. well, i do.
hopeless. it's hopeless.
live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
well -- such is life, flaemmchen.
how'd you know?
oh yeah? oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? federal express? hm? by the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. total waste. cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
man i'll try about anything; but i'd never touch a pineal gland.
what d'ya got?
and it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
that guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... this one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
i believe these young men are right.
gee... that's wonderful, jill.
he was innocent.
he's the one. you too. i remember. he was in a hurry. just a face job. dark hair, i said. then he killed doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and i ran... i ran.
the professor and dr. emilio lizardo were actually the first to discover the eighth dimension.  almost fifty years ago.  before buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  but there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and dr. lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  his hair was orange...
you should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. what'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
and to survive, my way, i need money. bobo knows about the stash in the car, so i didn't dare touch it, not if lilly dillon's dead. so that leaves this.
how do i get there?  tell me.
...what kind of man *are* you?
and what kind of sleeper?
do you need a break?
mozart! herr mozart, may i have a word with you please. right away.
oh, no, no, no. don't let it worry you. not at all. it's probably for the best.
kalen, it's all right, i'm here --
you investigating those murders out at the lake?
what do you think all that is worth, mr. thompson?
that's abnormal.
no, no.  i on holiday.
take this off.
make a right.  you can't miss it.
what a "drag."
let's go! let's get out of here!
we're into the second perimeter. they'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
watch your ass, shithead.
not if you don't count the sixth grade.
... i've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... i've known success... and i've felt love... my associates, chauncey - i've talked with them about you... they're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... i'm very fond of you, chauncey... and i understand eve... tell her that... tell her i'm madly in love with her...
uh--mr. president--you and i are about to be alone in here, sir. i'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  mr. president--i call the chair's attention to rule five of the standing rules of the senate section three. "if it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent senators."  mr. president--*i so direct*.
what are you talking about?
i would.
the germans are advancing on kharkhov.
how much money is involved?
hey!
what am i? the beer wench?
i'm going to start one of those custody suits. i don't give a fucking shit. you know?
rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
fifty-seven...oh, christ...
ready, sir.
it's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
you told him i was throwing a deuce, right?
i did everything you said, but it all seemed--
are you nuts, walking into a gun?
you should be in hospital.
i changed my mind.
just what i needed too.
suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside cyclops?
late renaissance, i think.  caravaggio or brunelleschi.
they're all pinned down. can't even get to the door.
twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with dick stensland.  they arrested a pierce patchett on an extortion scam.  guy ran hookers. he'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  charges got dropped.  insufficient evidence. you were supervising officer on the case and i was wondering if you remember anything about it.
you promised!
wait a second. did you say "patricide?"
he was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. he said he had never seen any like them.
everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. it doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
i'm afraid it's a little late for that. dillinger's shut off group 7 access. he must know what you're up to.
i guess you got my e-mail. i set up a purchase. ten cars.
the wizard of gore?
i told you goodbye. why are you here?
what?
what?
you! how can i ever get any fame playing you!
he's not here. we're getting divorced.
i'm afraid the rest of ward's island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, the charnier shipping company, of marseilles, france.
wait a minute, i think i know who stole it.
i wish you'd stop being playful.
nah, she don't go with nobody. she's only 15 years old.
you have the last act?
if you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
is it a poem?
i'm in my underwear.
i thought you might know her. she was seen here about a week ago. her name is jacqueline gibson.
where criminals can come in here... they take the...
greenpeace.
you can talk while i drive us to the police.
i'm thinking of investing with him. he worries me.
maurice chevalier! there's a fellow with personality.
when we gonna double back?
is he a winner?
by then it's too late! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! the chemicals will break down and dissipate!
there's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
where's all your things, jeffrey?
buddy's got a thing against ya, rock. some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
that would have kinda defeated the purpose.  and reed...  i'm saying it now.
i'm sorry.
something like that, yes.
victor laszlo?
it's okay. it's alright.
no. you have another part? you'll know what to do.
oh, she isn't really your wife.  how stupid of me...she was hauser's wife.
destruction, distraction. i feel the need.
what are you talking about?
no. don't be. i really enjoy hearing that. you're a terrific assistant.
i did keep an eye...
he will be soon. he's very ill.
the police break up our meeting. herr rick! we escaped in the last moment.
look, i'm busy.
you have children?
did it?
it's kind of late.
you can do it.
yes, i don't know what to make of it.
i can't right now.
no, we have to do it. but later, allright?
well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
her name?
you're calling me a pestilence? that's a hoot!
write me a note and ain't she sweet. i need a hand and where'd she go.
christ, will you look at your hair?
heavens no. my work now is... right now i'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
craig, i want you to meet my old lady, suga.  suga, this is craig.
then -
don't be an ass.
don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. the car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
hello, charles. has everyone checked in?
what?
...but you did it for greed, sidney - and that's pathetic.
yup.
interesting. do reckon i could fit through here?
and you weren't shocked?
yeah, i could too.  but... i don't know why i'm even asking you this. it's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. i don't know.  i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  if just one person would say...
getting a reading?
what's that about?
what do you think it is?
but there's no --
he came in through the cupboard.
to make sure you’re okay.
yeah.
later.
when you planning to cut back on that?
very ambitious. i like that.
sorry about that.  that's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
boyfriend?
i believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
oh, no, sir. i've never had a woman do that. i'm sure she drowned.
okay, now go under go under it ! shoot vader's tie fighter ! get him get him !
i know.
listen dewey i have to go to the bathroom.
i always wondered what you mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
eighteen--  and a half.
you just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. i don't understand. what's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
what are you talking about. how do you know?  i need her!  i need her.  she needs me.  i've got to get to her.
it's easy for you to be patient.
you think i'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  that's ezio pinza you're thinking about.  the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. he won't stop.
the woman's surrounded by fools!  she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
whoa, earl!
you don't like where i live?
you got to be kidding.
from the looks of those boys, the ripper too.
yessir. but then there's this other. he nods up the ridge away from the highway.
yeah, you bet!
heavens, no!  the owners don't like us to even talk about it.  i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or chemco will be destroyed.
oh my god. it's coming out.
he always was opinionated.
oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as i wanted you too.
he had a gun.  i have it now.
change is scary. robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. i've been in it over thirty years. and in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the elvis stamp and some gun laws. people are bored! they wanna shake things up!
you haven't told him yet...
what's the problem here?
it was.
"of the rich and famous".  of which we are neither.  are you out of your mind?  we can't afford this.
what are you talking about! can you transmit the code 3 -
i called her sister, mr. lowery, where she works, the music makers music store, you know? and she doesn't know where mary is any more than we do.
this is joe namath's old number, you know. you could get a lot of chicks with this. just don't pee in it.
you can't cheat an honest man. but a man like lionel dolby...
waddaya doing tomorrow night?
if anyone ever spoke to me, the way i heard... the way she spoke to you, i don't think i could ever laugh again.
are you sure you know what you're doing?
it's on the table.
all they got is advertisements. just like l.a.
all right... we've lost control of eight decks... three cargo bays... one shuttlebay.
you’re so...beautiful...
that gorilla in man's clothing-- mcgann.
no other reason —— no woman ——not the little miss gibson?
this is the edge, boy.  this is the end.
it's about to be a broken face.
mordechai. do you love your mother?
yes.
i've been hearing you.
yeah.  is that funny?
ann bishop millaney.
you heard what abbott said?
you got nothin' on me.
you can't take that... it's personal property...!
christ, what...
simplicity, hawk.
yes.
you call this... glory...?  all this... this blood... this smell of...
that's indescribable.
sorry about what happened at the dresden. i had no idea...
--so he says, "my son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and i got a rash on my ass so bad i can't hardly siddown. but you know me.  i can't complain."
that's it?
looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
i can't believe you wrecked my car. you're driving drunk. it's pathetic.
sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell i'm talkin' 'bout.
because is not democrash? all peoples created equal?
i don't want it now.
take off and meet me at eagle cave.
no, i don't.
does everything have to have a point?
it's sarah.
liz do you take fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
i'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
no thanks, i think we ought to get going though.
you all right, professor tripp?
i don't understand.  how can you part with it?  it has always been with you.
make the call.
hey, i invented fake i.d.s, alright. that's not the problem... they're playing disco music in there, man.
mr. reed would like you to call him.
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave. by my hand.
you sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, god in heaven, did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me? the greatest conductor on earth. i want him out the way. he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music. send him to stalingrad. isn't that what you did? you don't like criticism, do you, wilhelm?  you surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels?
but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates...
ask me them again. one by one.
you think it's simple, huh?
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein. the love affair that shocked europe! see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican! never has the screen dared...
helen, he's the man from the space ship!  i had that diamond checked at three different places. nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! after what bobby told us, that's enough for me. why is it nobody knows anything about him? why hasn't he got any money?
...my first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. what if i could get the money?
gillis, get this through your head.  i'm not just your agent. it's not the ten per cent.  i'm your friend.
...hello...?
mac's a pretty great director, joe.  he's a woman's director.  and nothing's happening.  course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... but it was discussed.  he had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
a travesty.  huh.  that's interesting, because i think you did it.
well, you never can tell these days, can you?
here's another wire, sir. this one's from charleston.  "checking every northbound train. also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. no success yet. will continue to do everything possible." signed: lovington detective agency, charleston.
what's this?
:--the strange endings of nature they have seen, may give the world new points of view and make their loving, living, and doing precious to all human...
you tell me, mike. what do i do?
you might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
terrified. still am.
oh jesus, sheriff, i am sorry. i meant to call you -- i got distracted -- the sumpter girl was not one of speck's victims. that's the good news.
you must think i'm mad.
but it's a different m.o.
no.  a chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  i think it was bothered by my light.
oh, lydia!
i'm not even listening.
... the old man is getting weaker, chance.
where's the camera?
please.
thank you.  and thank you for the flowers.
i couldn't find anything. everyone is packing up, they're leaving. word is a space ship is heading this way.
so this lawyer...
okay. good-bye.
sure!
showtime.
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
the originals?
gasparilla?
all you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? some chick?
you must go now. be careful on your way to your room.
ah, my dear francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
you've got a really tight team around you.  and everybody needs you!
m'mmm.
who?
the real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  what took you?
nothing.
not yet.
winter.  two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  which would suit me fine.
granted, the free huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
you know, i've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. i think you're on to something.
i don't know.
it's okay...you're going to be okay.
then we should...
yeah. this is an island, you know? takes too long to get into the city. we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  this could be a chance to win him over.
i'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  it tends to stain.
and anyway, i keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, rob...  are you there?  what are you thinking?
lloyd, where've you been? i've been waiting forever. i'm so embarrassed.
in the good old days, the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
this girl and the father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
have you listened to his morning show, "wake up with ballplayer"?
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, hold on. what?
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
are you nuts or something?
for real?
you can't do that yourself?
what's wrong with you?  we need your help.
bullshit, nick.  and don't tell me this is all just about charlie. it's not.
don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
then you've seen the scene where arnold schwartzenegger is talking to lou ferigno.
i want to know.
she's still talking to jesus.
it's my bit for the community.
as a matter of fact, i was just trying to decide the color of anne's eyes. i can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. what would you say, mrs. schuyler?
but for you, what comes first: music or love?
i surrender --
i don't believe you.
what was this for?
there!  happy?  i asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  now look what you've done!
every time you and marlon--
you dropped a glass.
kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
goddamn, merlin. there any part of the day you don't smoke?
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, ted. they knew your mom and dad loved you very much. they knew they did the right thing. but that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
for food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. dear lord, thank you.
it's dr. meridian. chase. do you remember me?
my mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
same old stuff.  i'm watching a man who won three overseas press awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
listen to me, alex.  these counselor's don't know anything.  they're full of shit. if you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
you're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
negative.  she is not a mission priority.
yeah?
not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... even kissing someone with aids is safe. but it there's something in your past you're worried about...
well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
excuse me?
this. and the gas.
did you think i wouldn't?
no, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
ay, palequero. never hochi in the p.i.
so we'll sell the house.
what's the matter?  you gotta get back to shaw?
...and they sit down right next to me...
hay—in my teeth.
i came to see you, you look fine.  we gotta go.
he's lying. she wouldn't have touched him. he raped her, then butchered her. her blood was all over his coat.
they're legal now.
oh god, i'm fucking nervous. i don't know if i'm ready for this, man.
private clinic. best of care. total privacy. we'll pay all costs.
where?
bravo!  what about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  do we let them go too?
her phone's probably tapped.
three months till retirement. what a way to finish.
they like you.  okay?
i'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
he wouldn't say.  edward... i think we got him.  his nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  you there?
you didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
it's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but i moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
it's the way they do things.
i wish we could hear them.
yes, mr. kane.
you get what you pay for.
oh, no, it's the way you lead.
you said nobody came in here!
our place, clell miller's, sammy johnston, the creeders. will hite.
with who?
define your terms.
it was just an accident.  like with dan.
but joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
i suppose it isn't logically impossible.
that's very nice.
good.  blood, urine and death get to you? try deep breathing.  or remember we all die anyway...
i wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the army medical corps.
what the hell kinda cop are you?!
well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
max, sit down. you're in no shape to kill anybody.
ray. ray, don't let go now, man. ray...
kent!
christ, i haven't felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978.
save it, baby. save it for mr. right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
i feel like you're turning me into a vcr.
two o'clock then... you know treves... it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
oh my god.
no way. big k taught me i ain't executive material.
here?
they're supposed to be evidence.    that's why bastaldi set this up.
you've done nothing but get rich off of me. how many books have you sold, gale? you think i don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
if i say no?
are you sure?
because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
suzette -- i told you not to bring the pearls. i will not wear them tonight.
who are you?
i don't know. he must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from fenner.  when he lands, we'll find out.
where to, miss?
like, normal style.  the...missionary position.
he wants you to come and see him.
you're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
where is it ?
what happened?
why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum? and who made the decision?
it didn't feel like a dream.
okay.
you think mafia hit?
forget it. how would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
oh frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  i got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... not that they'll know what to do with it in branton, missouri... probably use it as a planter.
brad!  oh, brad.
but please, mr. kane, don't buy any more paintings.  nine venuses already we got, twenty-six virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
i said say that again, son - because the next time you do, i'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
...what balls on this guy? what're we...  ...going steady? jesus.
how do you make him do that ?
wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? where's she work?
why did you let it get into a populated area?
nick!
steady it out!
i'm sorry?
yes.  oh, you mean to bring in! no. yes, i have some other things, no, i don't need to bring them in. this is all i need to stay here.
spanish wasn't hard enough?
looks slow tonight.
then the rumors are true?
speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
no more sharks.  i'll stay for another week, then....
it's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
fame.
let's go.
miss braslow, i'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
it hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
at one time the aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
thanks.  will you fix my hair?
captain barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
my wife wasn't diabetic.
pda?
we've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. i was framed. i was innocent.
can i tell you a story, rick?
mary is lila's sister?
you're really in love, aren't you?
so what do you feel like doing tonight?
not a chance.
come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? we'll see what we can work out.
gambling! i'd like that. i have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
if we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
six onion bajees!  great girl.  did you shake the mother off?
and i don't think that was tom.
you let him get away!
get `em ready.  you... come with me.
what, "is"?
hmm.
so you weren't interested in music at all?
this isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. there are no wild sex orgies.
they're not following me, dan.  i mean -- jon's gone, we're right on the brink of world war iii.  nobody cares about the watchmen.
nothing.  nothing.  do it.  do it.
four grand.
to love, you must be able to feel.
what's he doing here?
spying?!
i did some checking on that carter stevens character.  that familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the nih? turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
well, yeah, that's part of it. woman finds out how i live, that i'm not a published author, that i'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. if you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. you're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
he was a local legend back in the '70's. there was a song, stagolee kinda deal: "this is the ballad of jimmy bones/black as night and hard as stone..."
no, no, of course not.
he's a cop, vincent, he's french and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
he don't like popcorn.
mr. webster -- you will help him?
you're absolutely right.  you forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  but it wouldn't matter. sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  i don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
no now.
ugh!!  why do they have to do that?
yep. right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. the bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  this gun gets fired before ten o'clock. whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. i'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. that's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
you couldn't handle shit.  you just better come through with some kind of payment on tuesday...anything. understand?  hold onto your pay- check this week.
how nerdy is that? i'm wearing two pairs right now.
you mean our past as in me and sid. this has nothing to do with you gale.
huh?
well, i've got eyes, haven't i? why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
mcmanus wants to go in shooting. i said no way.
he wants to pull that tube out. it's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
it's an experimental model.  he doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
blow-dart hunting stick from papua new guinea. very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
do you want an argument or an answer?
have you got it now?
is billy going to be there tonight?
o.k.  where's the cash?
i'm scared i'm slipping back.
what did she mean?
who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
did i what?
mais certainment... a great deal of money. naturally i do not do it myself. i myself do not possess the nerve.  but i am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... it is a thing quite rare. champagne perhaps? tch, tch. don't say no. when a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  where did you play?
this was his nightmare. the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. i knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in london and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. he had to. if he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in saughton.
this room is full of ghosts.
you said there was a quick way out!
hello? hello?
get down -- where?
it is a blank. this is no time for zen.
uh, no, i didn't know that, brad.
absolutely.
let's hope... so far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
but let me tell you, man, i don't like your attitude already.
i am, joe.
i'll have to pay him back.
sure. we'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. i already told your mother. i hope you don't mind.
that about sums it up.
what'd you dream about?
why people die?  give it up, d'amour.  go home.
oh, thank g-d!  i'm not just super fat!
do you know what year it is?
you'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. last week i saw a purple martin. and the week before that, i saw a solitary vireo. that's rare.
holding hands?
i know more than i want to know about it. who's the father?
what are you doing out here?
the fog is too heavy, sir.
i'm will stanton, and um...i've had a little accident, as you can see.
in case no one knows what he does. tell me, ray, you ever wear one says, "undercover"?
you know about adele.
i... i can't answer that precisely.
it reminded me of you, so i bought it. it cost me more than all the others.
what did you hear?
yes sir, they –
i got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
is this a trick?
please answer my question.
-- is what?
it's a technique i read about. if you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
she looks just like you.
does that surprise you?
shall we start the, uh...
yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, i heard all about that.
my name's edwards...i'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
are you?
who'll make the rules?
motorcycle.
i see. and what do you do for a living, mr. fletch?
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
alright, henry -- we're gonna go your way.  crush this ellsberg character the same way we did hiss!
do you got something for me?
they can't find a sitter...  hello?  excuse me?  yes, uh, hold on.  just a moment.  it's skye davidson.  she needs directions to the house.  you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party?
and alone.
something wrong?
up north.
billy bear...
is there something about the house?
have your children been deaf since birth?
what?
my god, but you're determined.
i will accept your assurance, but i'm afraid i don't see your point.
florist?
bob...
you don't think much of yourself, do you?
about that shooting last night...i was there and...
there is no reason to assume other people were involved.
yeah.
so how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a u.s. marshal?
shhh. i need to concentrate on the blockbuster if i'm gonna destroy it.
use more ice.
i'm well, thank you.
you look pretty.
i'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
where is he?!!
you're still dressed?
because that's understandable, because. she blew the raid.
sandra sinclair.
well, we have plenty of those.  right over here.  we got the mgm series, astaire and rogers, the judy garlands...
thanks, albert.  think you could print up those schematics?
i hope those rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
how much?
okay... oh, umm, would you mind if i borrowed some clothes?
victor frankenstein.
you don't talk very much.
jesus ...
who's that?  quick -- i'm in love.
it's the only way. you know that. we'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
ten throws -- mr. webster?
i would if i could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. meanwhile...
that's not going to look too good on your service record.
now then, mr. o'connor, how long did ted kramer work for you?
how much time's left of your sentence?
how about brenda?
his twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
this isn't our area. whose area is this --
mr. levene, i think we have to talk.
roma!  i'm talking to you...
oh, but it does.  especially in light of the journey i'm about to make.
well, i think it's charming, rose.  but don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
that's 'cause i <u>wasn't</u> there.
like... a hawaiian sunset... the grand canyon. things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
she's protecting the doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
you have to call the police...
no, i'm finished. i'm not a writer. i'm a middle-school english teacher. i'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. it's okay. i like books. the world doesn't give a shit what i have to say. i'm unnecessary.  i'm so insignificant, i can't even kill myself.
you okay?
i sure like the way he talks. it sounds like a race car motor idlin'. it makes me not be nervous.
that would be appropriate, yes.
i know.
shoot.
fuck you.
come on russell!...  who the fuck's russell?!
damn.  i hate that!  i hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
alone. all alone.  oh, you strange -- strange creature.
all right now: get mad at them eggs. eat it there boy! bite it! gnaw on it!
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch. does that sound alright, mr. creasy?
off the peg?
didn't principal jaffee call you?
hi.
then why are you talking about this?
her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... what did you do to her?
it's so simple. we buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that sick boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. i put up two. i come away with six.
listen, mr. dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. you've got more friends than anybody in this town. little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. all you've got to do is—
it takes me comfortable.
most important...i want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
let's be reasonable human beings here. we're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
where will you be?
yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when i pull the trigger. death?  don't talk about death to me.  i have been living with death for the last six months.  why do you think i'm in the hospital?  i take a handful of pills to get away from you.  and then here i am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  i have no friends left.  no job.  i can't live.  i have to live with people. this death business... i'm sorry!
the missing scientists.
mama?
now, that was worth waiting for.
please be looking for me.
i bet you have a great family.
-- i don't know --
whose justice? yours or god's?  when will you stop?
now, where we goin', convict?
no.
mrs brown.
but i need documentary proof. you know of anything like that?
they are everywhere!
your honor, this is a tape from miss lawson's answering machine.  i would like to play it now.
aren't you going to say anything?
i don't know...
i don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that death would set you up nine months in advance.
you want us to give you a ride?
i think you did alright by god under the circumstances.  your people are here for you, laz. this is your home. no shame in showing your face.
yes.
i know.
m'honey pretends to be impatient with me, barton, but she'll put up with anything.
what have you done?!
if you've lied to me to me --
thank you. the truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
what about it?
that's swell. however, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from mrs swan, they'll only take you so far. there's this guy in san francisco, i've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. his name is jacques carcanogues. i'm not sure i'm pronouncing it right. anyway, he's a frenchman.
what thing?
he took your wallet?
sometimes... don't know why it is... i get so hot i can't stand it. i just start sweating like a dog. you ever get like that?
you don't think...
this isn't a game.
yeah.  it should be fun.  you wanna come?
it's all about who you know.
why, dad?
i'm talking to you gently now.
i didn't know you took pictures.
do what--
then we establish how wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
fifty degrees below and still falling.
cooch. what's the fort laramie treaty?
that's right.
what did you think you were doing in his tent?
why, beckett?
no, gino!
i'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
going somewhere, margie?
you're driving.
dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? and if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
a great deal more than that, i believe...
mm.
julia!
anybody hungry?
no, you're not.  so stop comparing yourself to him.  you have no reason to ... you have everything you ever wanted. you've earned it.  why can't you just enjoy it?
er ... +      you are the keepers of the holy grail?
i see "elegant."
give the guy air. everyone to a neutral corner.
we did talk about naomi.
oh, let me see - way back in 1713, i think it was, that father perrault stumbled into the valley, half frozen to death. it was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
remember, al... we'll be at the ritz-carlton in boston tomorrow night! or at the funeral parlor. it's stickney and-
ms. toller.  i'm asking you now, under oath, did samuel lonbardo rape you?
nice shot, lins.
i'm no bodyguard.
were you?
glenmorangie.
do i know you?
he's going back.
that crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  there isn't even milk in the fridge.  the rent's due.  now come on --
thank you for going along with me. i just didn't want to explain anything... i'll send you a check.
i don't know. i can't remember. it was just in my dream.
you stupid bastard.  you havn't got any arms left.
how long you been coming here?
do you know what this is, frances?
you expecting somebody you know?
tell my dad i'm sorry about the watch.
"dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  a lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  damn!  eddie, i'm sorry i can't remember all this.  i'm an old man. it's too long.
norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
how do you like your coffee? black?
i don't know...
you ever take a bath with a man before?
will you let me explain!
honey ...
come on, jean. get rid of your cigarette. concentrate.
so, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... is your problem really that you're... lonely?
it was pamela landy's op. the guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. i haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
they sure do stink.
an adult bookstore. he was very excited about seeing it. you think home is under a dirty bookstore in the valley?
and i'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
oh. right. won't you have a seat?
of course i am.
children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
oh brad - mmmm - oh yes, my darling - what if...
look, you can't buy what i know. ya can't. i've seen it all! i got pain an' i got experience.
i'll pick the first job! i mean... i know a girl down at the bank. see if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
<u>botany bay</u> -- oh no!
ya, somethin' like that.
when are you coming home?
the truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
were the leads...
sit down!
this is barry.
no shit?!?! you know him?
what's the matter?...grace?
no.  we're all of us after something.  it's easy for me to fight for the common man.  my father could only dream that i would be... a general someday?  and what of my daughter or son?  i know what i'm after.  but now, with all this talk about compromise?  it means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
the bitch.
well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
you can't play around with these tent people.
i don't.  i just know they were there when i left.  i'm giving you helpful information is all.  you know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
wow! this is like my dream room! are these all records!
i'm fine. who is this?
but if the jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
the hell it ain't square one! ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
i see. tell me, harold, do you remember your father at all?
yes indeed.  you almost got yourself killed last night.
no, no.  you're her best friend.
i'm sorry, jimmy.  but with this movie and two difficult stars --
i feel i ought to take care of her.
take care.
it's about destiny, picard. about a reman outcast who...
what'd ned say?
incidentally, joe, where're you staying?
i don't know. i would've done something. this is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? this place is so stupid. i can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. with all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
the suit will stretch. you should try it --
what the hell happened?
jesus god, it's going through.
thank you for seeing us... we... just felt that it was time to discuss...
how nice.
where have they gone?
but, andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
ah... pity, pity...
good luck?
they murdered her, mrs. mathews, i'm sorry.  it happened a month after she ran away.  she's been dead all this time...
she fucked me too.
so that was it? one bump in the road and you gave up?
lemme tell you something.  vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  nobody even know what he looked like until now...
what do you mean? it's wonderful. really, it's - it's marvelous! people love me here.
it's kind of a sports bar
mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
yeah. what are you doing now?
man! i hate it when i can't rent videos!
y'know what else bothers me?  "shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  the baby don'say a word, what the fuck is the motherfucking mocking bird gone say?  you follow me...?
only if i'm dead!
i'm sorr--goddamn mario brothers. goddamn gates.  goddamn rutherford auction house.  by the way, how many seconds?
science...i suppose.
mr. travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
yes, it really causes problems. sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  but if it's too much trouble, i understand ...
she told me.
i don't get it, you get a scholarship to nyu, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  and it's funny, but i feel as if i've known you all the time.  but i couldn't have, could i?
nicole!
don't worry, shelly, i'll handle leo.
do i really want to know what you're talking about?
let me guess:  wonderland weather.
yeah.
you smell that.  you smell that?
you're thirteen months older than me, frank. that might've meant something in the apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
alright. this is your penance. say two rosaries and... be careful, loretta. reflect on your life.
it's reply paid.
it's a good play, but risky.
oh, man.
you'd better sit here and keep warm while i go for help.
you better not be ragging me... if you're flying upside down...
be quiet! fenner's the best pilot in china. he knows what he's doing.
how 'bout yourself?
hear you roar ...
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar.
i don't understand.
i don't want a bodyguard. i want the man i fell in love with.
come on. we're goin' over to elton's.
ms. tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
'commander' decker?
with my luck, now it'll rain.
you all right, ethan?
he asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
what airport would you use.
you got the extender?
want to know why they're called faith, hope, grace and charity?
no shit?
get out of here, lando!
well, sure i do.
lightning struck.  we caught it in a bottle.  don't let it out.  i want to be with you, joe --
--and so determined to live that i'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
i don't know -- maybe twenty miles... of course i'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to i mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
cook, by god!  cook!  you're the nigger now.
mbwun.
ask her.
no.
no.
three-one-zero, aye!
what ten thousand?
oh-h, mrs. hillyer, i... i can't think. i... i'm not really sure.
a nice, big cock.
i've got some news. your daughter's all right. at least i think she is.
mama?
how could you call him?
you all watch your step.  we got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  you fall, i don't wanna have to come pick you up.
bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
they told me i was well. they had to turn me loose.
the queen has consented?
tell me a joke funny man. hee hee.
don't make allowances.  i'll never be ready.  some people just shouldn't have children.  i'd be a terrible fucking mother, joe.  i did want it for us.  but i couldn't do it.  i don't really think i can do it.
three nights charleston, south carolina.
i believe he is probably lying.
can't keep his eyes off my legs.
i think they're from 'you know'.  some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  no light.
this knife is filthy.
my god, what the hell are you...?
... no...
my business is heroin, i have poppy fields, laboratories in narseilles and sicily, ready to go into production.  my importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  the risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
now in haskins vs. haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
no, i mean about her appearance. if she should leave the valley - what would happen?
scotch and plain water, i think.
i think, pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." this is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
oh, you're not so badly off. there's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
you can't duck this, bill. i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen.
oh, god, dj, what do i... how do i...
right.
sure.
and what?
what's the matter?
yeah--why--
well, who told me to take this cow path?
sorry, king.  my leg's stiff as a board.
uh, sorry, i'm going to have to...  ...i really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, i can't thank you enough for...
its cramped in here isn't it brian
well where is she?!
here are the keys to the taurus. there's plenty of groceries in the fridge. and i left money on the kitchen table. and don't forget...
but what if they see it, nuwanda?
rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
i've seen it twice. i went back tonight to be sure. it's a brave and honest piece of work.
bully for you.
how's astronaut training?
i know what i'm doing and i know why i'm here!
who the hell wants to see life?! people are sick to death of life! they want make-believe, pal. fantasy. they want tarzan and jane, not tristan and isolde.
it's over you, gordon.
sure ronald? you're ready alright.
then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
i collect spores, molds and fungus.
well, the story's practically finished. i'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
you--or the vancouver police department?
by taking away our legs. now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. probably the whole city. they gave us the fighting spirit. before this happened i was content. now i'm pissed off. now i'm half a man and i've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
we need confirmation on the time frame.  location still uncertain. remote witnesses are hooked in...
did you call, sir?
good going, slink!  now, just, just tie it on to something!
i'm not going anywhere. we're a team.
the girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? jesus, miles!
- you're not.
fredo.  where are you going?
about him?
well, yeah, but i went through the program. i haven't had a drink since--
did you call the state police?
you're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
how are you? you weren't in class. i called as soon as i heard...
what's the matter?
aah!
hello kay.  your father's inside, doing some business.  he's been asking for you.
it's not real...  that's not me.
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman?
no, i'm--
you remember margie fogg?
yeah?
bloody hell, i can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because i don't read 'hello' magazine.
please...help me...
fires a burst.  germans drops.
hello?
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
none too discreet, is he?
uh, <u>look</u>....
that requires me goin' out tonight?
yeah, yeah— here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
no. you?
they think i'll make friends if we move.  just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
thanks, walter.
yes, he knew.  just..
i thought so.
sarah -- with an h?
have i died?
is there any other way out of this place? anyone?
it's not your province to ask.
that was unbelievable what you did to lucas. the guy's an animal.
me?  you've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  so - caravaggio - hana thinks you invented your name.
irena.
i am all right, mama. that's why i called, to let you know. i gotta go.
you made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  what do you think i'm doing?
i was calling yesterday.
my apologies, miss.  as you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
main bus...
is he here?
i agree there should be more.
i know. i stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
i'm just an m.d.
did you see that sucker burn?!
god, i don't know who's weirder, you or me.
helping people makes me happy.
they will if they catch him in the act. you can make that happen, dad.  you can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
better hurry, doc.  a real story.  with a real reporter.
<i>the bounty hunters have arrived. they will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>where do you want to meet?</i>
billy... what the hell's wrong with you?
you're on a roll kiddo. enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
you're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
jesus.  how much do you know about dyson?
yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  come on, clarence, lets go. elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
b-but it's our money --
can i ask you something, kittridge?
i got a nurse in mind.
captain spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the enterprise to the nearest star base and alert starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
it has your ring.
comrade buljanoff...
if i send out the troops, will you all calm down?
always.
two.
it was off the statue.  in the club.
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over, too. i have a girlfriend now.
help me here...
you cook very well!
only a last name would be nice.  or the nearest town to this...clinic.
the people will not allow it.
nonsense. you've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. it's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. we've got something between us nothing can change.
no, i'm just going to head home.
it's all right, jabez. we'll find something to pay stevens.
isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot?
something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, adam, and i think you should do it and i think you should do it right away.
how's the movie going?  your movie.  you are making a movie, aren't you?
oh yay! and then i could be as happy as you!
31 people.
i've loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you, jeremiah. i've just always been too scared to show it.
too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! nobody gets into mother's draws except daddy!
what's the big deal? it's not like i was on guard duty or something.
what happened to you?
then make your choice.
kip's in trouble
who?
who's this?
yes, sir. but soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
my violin is avenged!
sorry about last night.
i don't know. one of your friends.
you're right. probably penis, mouth and neck.
what?
the tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
tell me it's not true.
i don't have a boyfriend.
very well put.
but you had so much *responsibility*.
you wanna know what i think?
raised her like she was, but no, walter's my only child.  he was a good boy, till the army took him.
hello, operator services.
what do i tell them?
i'd kind of like to see grant's tomb - and the statue of liberty.
scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
i was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
when they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, i still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. so, i ask you again, mr. mcclusky, what's changed?
yeah.
your sexual orientation?
four.
me too.  i got a stomach full of xanax.  i took what was left of a bottle.  might've been too much.
how?
put it on my account, please.
but i loved the second one she wore. and this one --  -- is beautiful.
because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  i'd really like to look...what's the word i'm looking for?...
for what?
i'm going to bed.
everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
wait, mama, wait. i have something to tell you. i've decided... well... i'm not going to make movies anymore. i thought that's what i wanted, and i went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but i was miserable, mama, and it nearly killed me. so now... now it's over. i want a different kind of life, something... simple. i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and i'll have dogs and cats -- i feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... it's going to be okay, mama, i know it. and i love you.
oh, will!
what do you think?  max firepower or...?
yes, sir.  i'm here.
if the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  old, too old. fat, too fat.
me?
what's the matter? you on their team now? you think i'm the guy?
it's not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
hey, cut it out sid, that tickles. i'm serious! you guys are related, right?
i don't know.  i have to make a stop in vegas.  business to finish.  then maybe i'll head to santa barbara.  i might be able to pick up some action there.
wha--
go to the roof now.
very moving, patterson; i'm touched you confided in me.  but i don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. i've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
but it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
lousy. and i have siesta hair. i'm thinking of canceling the speech.
okay i'll see you tomorrow night then.
didn't i say?
i want to pick up my car.
what about the suicide?
i'm dying for a shower.  you could use one too.  and we'd better check that bandage.
and you're at this third stage
awake? what do you mean?
it's a miracle.
yeah.
why? you uncorked a bottle. from what i can tell, i got here just in time. any later and you'd have made the front page, running down main street naked, smoking camels out of your butt.
exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. i see them all the time in the penny saver.
why would she come here...
why are you picking on me for?
keller, black lion squadron. i knew him at pensacola. he's damn good.
there's more!
a moonstone.
hey--i can be out of control.
no, this is the place for the young yakuza.
or rosebud?  how about it, jerry?
why, baby? what'd i do wrong?
i'll give you what you need -- i have money.
probably a little too long.
can you be quiet?
right ... you're the gatekeeper.  but i want dana.  dana, speak to me ...
duh. what else would i be talking about? now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. he snagged this coke. but, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
why don't you stay at larry's house? there's plenty of room.
yes. price...
mr tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with bella.
... we're with franklin, jennings and roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
i hadn't forgotten. i ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and i felt so bad if i would have come to her birthday without that, i just stayed at home.
you know they invented something while you were inside.  called a watch.
it's okay...he doesn't believe me. that's his right. i'm starting to think i'm crazy, too.
how do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
yeah.
what?
they will find out about you.  they will lock you in a place worse than brother buddy's.
of course.
why'd you ask him.
not just yet, baby. there's...there's something daddy has to do.
i don't got the money.
i'm no doctor. but i'd say he's in a coma.
yeah.
my name is shirley, but they call me betty, and her name's twinky.
yeah, but come on... all i get to do is cry and get insulted.
what's left of my blood.
tell me, harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
why are we doing this?
somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
feel bad about ol' fred.  just can't hold back when i'm feelin' woolly.  still, feel kinda bad. but now we're square.  anyway no use for holdin' a grudge.  i deserved a rap in the head.
know where he is?
alexander.
if i leave, you will be right back where i found you...
if you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  you've never respected me!
i... suddenly felt such a fool.
say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's apt, harry!
i am asking.  you to me.
i tried to help you...!
you don't need to lose any weight. you're kidding, right? you look great. very fit.
but you're his friend.
what do you guys want?
i show a cop on horseback.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. they've got all the l.a. phone books, plus medical directories...  we're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? i'm making this my personal mission.
now, jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  even st. michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  but the serpent hoards a pile of booty, achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
but there may be a few around somewhere.
nothing... there's your ninepence.
well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. make you a hero sure as you're born!
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to.  other than that, there's never any reason.
pacific coast bell.
yes, general kutusov, i daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  napoleon would simply spend the winter in moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  another lesser possibility might be to march on st. petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
uh-huh.  tell me what you think of this first.
yes, sir.  what's up, general ripper?
why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, mr. webster. there's this matter of little daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- i can't really talk about it, even to ma -- she puts it all on jabez and i won't stand for that.
righteousness...
tell me what you saw tonight. tell me.
welcome to our show!
"extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  and by the by, you know of a player in overtown who goes by the name of "things aquatic"?
what's on your mind, lieutenant?
i don't think so.
don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
he's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  he's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  that's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  did she call him back?
do you think this is wise, boy? crossing blades with a pirate?
it's hardly been used at all. i got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. swear to god. that's like new.
xxxxxx
what's she done?
i w- i was gonna be back before she woke up.
you got a tab?
don't worry, man. it's all for you.
aaron - lieten to me...  it's been lasher - from the start!
what's this?
they said they were goin' to the twin cities?
woke up real early. sun was shining. just thought i'd mess around, try to learn a song.
bobby--
they're not after you, they're after me.
oh that, she just likes to play.
you won't have long to wait. in just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. off with you now, amy. go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
good morning, mr. dowd. do you think you might be up to cross-examining mr. ortega this morning?
goodbye. thanks for the lift.
i wish there was a way to bring them back home.
to the riviera.
i need to get your signature on some papers here, kit.
oh.
shall i alert dr. mccoy?
mr. kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus.
just okay...
well, dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  is there any chance you and kathryn will get married in amity?
it's okay... it's okay...
you're rude. i mean, you're very rude.
after the movie.
oh. what's wrong now?
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
i do.  it's little shit like that sends people to jail! we have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
no. no! no!
paul...  ...i have to talk to you.
a *day*!
because you don't really seem here.
...we, we love her, dick and me...
this is it. definitely. this is it, but they changed it.
i think perhaps i'll just sit down.  i don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
it's ok.
thank god. oh thank god.  tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? you ain't got to hide, have you?
it's lisa sherman. but she still looks like we're eighteen.
i'm utterly satisfied.
what time?
i've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, cathy -- even i would never have believed it is of you.
he's special.
general anderson, the problem was the terrain. if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park...  we should be able to take him down.
that sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on easter day.
i'm sorry, momma.  maybe next time.
christ, crabs, what do you expect me to do? the kid's practically in a coma.
yes.
you murdered that girl, eddie.  six years ago...
i think he's got a terrific personality.
i mean, how could you not play anymore? that's so strange to me...
but you didn't.
you think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. it doesn't work, sebastian.
i need money.
you are responsible...what has happened?
so how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
you play all these places?
we have to talk.
wait.
sure.
you're playing an angle, college boy.  you're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  if they're making you a detective, watch out.  some bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
i'll learn.  c'mon--
she say where he is?
about his letters -- that's all she remembered. quite violent material, i'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. but that's not unusual either.
we'll have to replace commander sonak. i'd still like a vulcan there, if possible...
what's the matter?
got any booze in the house?
you won't be made to feel! period. you've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! well, go to hell! it isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! you're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
i was wondering if you'd finished considering?
oh... sully.
i am totally unappreciated in my time.  we can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  you think that kind of automation is easy? or cheap? you know anybody who can network eight connection machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what i bid this job?  because i'd sure as hell like to see them try.
tod was.  he was with ratan.
but there isn't a b-2 bomber.
the greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  now i must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  it began on the night when louis was born.
i... no, i... i just can't...
what do you mean -- when you were a kid?
...the guy the army guys are lookin' for!
i am. i'm always there, but i only shine at night.
get inside quick, they'll stop.
what are you thinking?
what do you know?
no, not exactly a man of the people.  "also known as vigo the cruel, vigo the torturer, vigo the despised, and vigo the unholy."
and what if it does?
pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
yeah.
beautiful.
i'm not really sure. i had a shower...and some sorbet?
juicy?
well, i was hoping to get my balls licked.
lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. could i see your license, please?
no rain.
daddy, you home now... that's all i want -- i don't want nothin' else...
he kept saying, "let it happen, let it happen."  then he just stopped.
ann, i don't understand why this freaks you out so much. you didn't do it, i did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
how'd it go at the trial?
i think so.  maybe.
yeah. i really blew it. i still think about her.
i simply don't have it, joe.
big girls don't cry-i-eye.
the second note.
i don't want to know.
billboards about accidents.  kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. it all felt...just wrong. just like... 
i guess i got carried away
oh my god trevor! it hurts!!  oh my god, oh my god. trevor, it's coming out.
yes, it is.
due in nashville.
there is no contradiction between faith and science. true science.
perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
am i on my feet...?
it's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. i told you about 'em.
where he can't get it?
i've got a date.
something stupid.
a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
didn't you hear what i said?
that's lovely.
he is...  you sat in that coffee shop across from school--
goddamnit!  i don't believe this is happening!
getting married.
wow.  that's more than a dress. that's an audrey hepburn movie.
what about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "park" ? wasn't that a computer glitch ?
so? how was school today?
yes! you own the coffer of shadow. nothing can withstand its power.
it's really nice up here, isn't it?
whattaya think you're in now?
yeah.
i don't know.  if this one's any faster than that other one...
it wasn't your fault, bob. you had your brother.
i'm gonna be sick.
that's impossible.  i'm a doctor, i'm --
i love you very much, my dear.
i know a couple of addicts. stupid wee lassies. i feed them what they need. a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. it's easy money for me. not exactly a fortune, but i'm thinking, 'i should be coining it here.'  less whores, more skag. swanney's right. get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. what do you think?
all right, all right, so we can say he is good.
-- i bet you have.
when you were gone last year -- where were you?
excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
how much is it?
pacqualinincheewa root.  means "cougar fang." cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
who is it?
yes?
well, sure... that's good, then.  all i mean is, i'm lucky i met you.
yeah, layaway.
executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
can i help you, sir!
don't feel bad.
what the hell's going on?
next, paine.
shut up!
i never played for winos.
we cannot go through there....
but tell me --
yeah. you ever seen any of those?
which way?
it's never big enough.
maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. you will not be able to walk into the casino. i'm tellin' you.
i didn't say anything.  what's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, colonel?
naw, i already ate.
was i?
well, i must say you're handling it very well.
do it.
what, sweetheart?
negative. he's established a security field around the control room...
coffee?
he complained of not feeling well. i thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
who, for instance?
shit!
i know.
i meant me, my son and my daughter.
now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. get a firm grip, ma!
shut up, billy!
that's okay.
your buddy. that fat guy. the king couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. he didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. it ain't personal. it's business.
why don't you people let me alone? i'm minding my own business.  you mind yours.
don't let the bedbugs bite.
ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
he took a shot.  he's unconscious.
july of '71.
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio, didn't you?
no, he was talking about girls, i think.
man, you're losing your audience.
i think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  a little scared... and a lot curious.  maybe more than you want to admit.  but doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  think of it as broadening your horizons.
it's a guy in a cage.
what the hell is that?
your i --
why do you always use your left hand?
i don't know. any new bodies accumulated out there?
that's the nature of all progress, william. don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
what if he's busy tonight?
i understand, but can i use it. i'm not that young anymore, so i'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
you're not very ambitious, are you?
hello, ed.
cost you a thousand for the bond.
what am i gonna do?
i guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
anybody been hurt?
i waited another four minutes.
that is enough!  you are a good servant, d'artagnan, but you forget your place!
before we start talking about stewardess, let's get beaumont out of the way first.
we got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
i heard they were filthy birds.
you come to peddle me some tapes, lenny?  for old time's sake?  make a couple bucks for the holidays?
mr. hoover was a realist.
exactly what are you looking for, apollo?
mr. harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
i'm on the side of our mother holy church.  besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
it's unbelievable.
mathesar? what is that?
but i didn't kill anybody.
you know, miss fremont -- he might just have something there.
summer would have been a lot less without you. you're a true friend, donald.
the other car!
why would you wanna do that?
oh, really.
mason???
a friend of mine. i don't know his real name. he's dead now.
i'm bella.
whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
i want to know why you see him. is it a patchett payoff?
is he staying here?
i owe you, since i goofed up this one.
does it bother you to hear?
fourteen carat?
the children want me.  they're calling me.  they need me.
well maybe i can get you something.
all right ... i got some hungry people in there ... i want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
believe it.
where could it have gone? how could it get across the water?  they're only lions, yes?
the family room.
are you anywhere near the penthouse?
things go round 'n round, don't they?
gosh!  well--looks good as new. if there *is* any damage, i'll--
i think i'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
well, what then?
what?
look, mr. desmond, i didn't count on it turning this ugly.
try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolan's farm to see him.
my main man! please don't leave me here alone. my head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! get me outta here!
you're right. only you can do that.
try sitting down.
yes, sir.
is he for real?
'bout seven.
what kind of photographs?
what's going on?
i don't know. that's too easy. i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. that's so easy.
couldn't help it. no offense. she's not your wife is she...?
i still can't believe i'm being financed by an oil company. especially when they get a look at these pictures.  technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  what's that?
it's just a name.
why don't i just wait three weeks and tell her i was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
and god love you for it.
really?
sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
who made us what we are?
...nicky was dreamin' his own kind of vegas.
that doesn't look like very much clay.
is that liquor?
that was great, mr. keon, dave. thank you. ok, group, we have two new member. say hello to scott and his father, mr.... ehville?
weird, man. no fuckin' electricity. what do you figure they plug all their shit into?
no. too... upright. might've been a person.
we found him like this --
and who were the detectives who assisted you, mr. reynard?
relax.  we'll drop the song.
...you moved too, didn't you?
elmo's...
lester, it just happened.
the precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
david, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
hoh graphic!  i'm going to dream of ears for a year!  ugh!
maybe.
look at us.  we are old men now.  but once we were young.  and when we saw injustice, we fought it.
move! can't you do something??
these ladies aren't starvin' to death. they make minimum wage. when i worked for minimum wage, i wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
what?
i think you are afraid to ask me for advice. i think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. i think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
well, david moved out here and started his residency. then he met leslie --
hi. this is nikki. leave a message. 
and maybe my lawyer.
i can't help myself. i don't know what's the matter with me.
i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much i don't care!
yes, sir, you bet i would.
i'm going to go to hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
you're kidding. when for?
glasspack. he said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now i dunno. he's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
another couple of good men get burned up for their city? is that how it's going to read?  you're the only one that knows.
i think i better go.  i'm just not into it tonight.  i'm sorry.
that's what i want to tell ya. i've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? you were right -- i needed help.
what?
no, i'm afraid not.
i don't think so. i've fallen in love. this is what people who've fallen in love look like.
and exactly what business are you in, mr. bond?
yes.
he said if i let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
comin' in or goin' out?
i don't know what it's called.
you can't be late.
no, i have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
billy and his penis don't deserve you.
every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
did you see that?
who the hell is this!?
guess i should have been telling your father.
we're almost at the rendezvous - i thought you'd want to know...
no...
last i heard he went to san diego.
look. that telegram was all scrambled. it was actually from thompson, not to him. western union must have gotten the names reversed. i have to get going. i have to get out to the track.
hey, janet, it's chad.
frankly, j.j., i don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
yeah.
are you drunk?
it's the waves.  god's music, my mother used to say. she was crazy for the ocean.
we'll see?  what does that mean?
then why did you call the police in the first place mother, huh?
you know what they say. they say things are no good in this house. catherine, your son is married. leave him in peace. he wantsa be alone with his wife. they don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. now i tell you what i think. i want you come live with me in my house with marty and me. in my house, you have your own room. you don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. we will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. you are dear to me, and you are dear to marty. we are pleased for you to come.
because i want to get married.
people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
hell yes.  he does this every year. there's nothing to worry about.
rats...
well, she does know a lot about wine.
it's loaded with what?
captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
c’mon.
oh, i don't know.  i'm just nervous. i gotta figure out what to do.
the great communicator.
cheraw falls.
if i can get to the chopper, i'll meet you at the rendezvous.  don't wait for me.
i hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
he knew it was a set up. he was ready for it.
i'd like to have a word with you. this is agent matheson, fbi.
may i see your license.
kind of a bad neighborhood, snake.
now don't give me a hard time.
you remember that story?
uh-huh?
hey... you got a fine one right here!
i had to give some to inez.
why don't you think so?
you know what i love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
yeah.
he's a jerk.
now listen carefully. stan and kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. if any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
i'm glad you're female.  do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
hurry, sister!
...you shoot a great game of pool.
i love you.
she said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. you waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
not here.
he says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
ruben.
she asked me to come over.  she said she had something to tell me.
of course she does and i must say i'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  do you think that's why we're meeting.  to help us say goodbye to rafe?
we're not dropping it. now that's the reason, isn't it? i'm a dirty degenerate, aren't i? i'm not fit to --
i'm telling you, she's not a nun!  get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
we're very curious about that, too. would you care to talk about it?
how is the "date night" idea going over with eve?
maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
no.
oh, it's not your fault.  it's just that every now and then mother nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  something goes wrong inside.
all right. truth. i believe that one. why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
mr. denby--what do you think i ought to do with that part?
jasper lamar crabb?
the board of parrish communications - is hereby called to order.  our sole order of business is an acceptance of john bontecou's generous offer and --
only family allowed, nancy. you know the drill.
yah, you said you'd have a think about it. i understand it's a lot of money -
we are just not used to handsome knights ...  but you are wounded!
what did you expect, a st. bernard dog?
it's a pleasure to finally meet you, roman.
...so you knew all this and yet y--
pike, i don't think you're up to this.
do you like that?
you knew her?
you scored with two chicks?!
yes...
so, do we go on?
let's check out the penguins.
ok. but do me one last favor, will you. can you give me two hours? that's all i ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. i suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
that a nice way of saying i rode the bench?
that's not the reason i'm here.  i swear it.
forget it; i'm suddenly without an appetite.  you're making big trouble, carmine.
we both missed.
buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
she's not a suspect. what is her motive? there's nothing, nothing connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
we're both gonna leave. leave the island. i've been talkin' to tricks. we think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. they're crated up real small. they've got air canisters. there's food inside. even a little motor.
let's shoot this fucker!  where do i go?
the internal monitors read normal.
why do you think --
you must look at my face and not at the floor.
i gotta stop by turley and meet a guy.
i could've got more ... if i'd just ... i don't know, if i'd just ... i could've got more...
do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all addison?
new york.
this is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
shouldn't we wait for the others?
what kind of man are you?
i don't know. i just think that you would love it.
we know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
no harm done. everything's okay now.  i've got to be going.
i had another dream last night.  the dead man laying on top of me and i had nothing to eat. and the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
that's disgusting!
pop, can i have the car? i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
i watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing this night. he's waited for it, inhumanly patient. hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. you can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
monsieur rick?
mrs. bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  do you know how your husband died?
i'll rent the truck from you.  you can stay here, you can go.  whatever you want.
why memphis?
c'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
any girl?  okay.  let's start with that one.
i'm helen tasker.  harry's my husband.  and you are?
no problem.
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  please.
make sure the prince doesn't leave this room until i come and get him.
i don't want to hear it.
what?
can't you fix him up here? ...he's my livelihood. listen.
who?
you a god damn witch?
yes, and i'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i.a.s. convention.
what do i do?
i used to be a nurse.
just a second, that's all!
well, it means another two weeks in paris.
ben gay.
we've got minutes until it hits, not hours... victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. we need to abort.
now where? will?
lawrence is getting derogatory again.
they don't suspect <i>him</i>?
you got the cash?
your father liked shifting. he said it brought him closer to the engine. "like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
who said that? gary cooper, james stewart, henry fonda? huh? 
what? to completely damage me?  to send me to therapy forever? what?
let him find out on his own.  i want the hong kong police handling this.
morning.
what song?
but wudan does not accept women.
and all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. birds of the world, unite!
what was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
call it a reckoning of character.
oh, remember that time i got my training bra and you --
did the justice lawyers sign off?
ready?
all right -- i'll take you to the subway.
what if i take you with me?
say what, manray?
my dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and i fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
however, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, i am a representative of the french government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our american brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of king george of england.  vive la france!  vive l'amerique!
very nice...
i don't owe them a goddamn thing.
your aunt called me.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
deal! i'm dealing with two guys named cheech!
i'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
what do i say?
i told her she was going to meet her father.
don't let this talk of heroes upset you, jack.  sigurd's sword is no great thing.  the volsung killed fafnir.  you killed lindfarne. that's one worm apiece... i'd say you and sigurd were neck-and-neck.
now, aim --
handsomely?... who sent you?
no, you look good. i was just wondering.
i'm trying, david.
how do you do, mr. matuschka?
you know, i don't feel like playin' tennis.
locked.
told him what?
if father lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called constable haller to tell him marty's sending poison-pen letters?
otho, i can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
you said that.
you mean... george mccord, the actor?
what??
romeo will answer it?
yeah?
or what?  no one can capture ivy but the big bad bat.  crap!  you just want her for yourself.  don't you?  answer me, damn it!
captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
vigi, vigi, vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
uh oh.
but you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, mr. richard?
two bs?
i know -- i know --
i wish we could've brought him with us.
i want to see that moon in the champagne.
are you safe?
...he just lets himself get pushed around all the time! people walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
we'll come up with the next big thing.
friedman lives with you at the ambassador?
no! at least i don't think i am!
like what?  bank teller?  what do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  i got a wife and kids. i can't live on that -- you want to live on that?  what do you make a week?
kind of a sign, you're saying.
"his greatest greatness."
what if frank came over here and found us?
of course, mrs. majors -- janet -- but i'm puzzled.  if she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
are we going to ever see your father?
upper west side.
you feeling all right?
it would be great if i'm crazy.  if i'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  i'll never have to live underground.
it was the nicest thin i've done in a long time.
now, lydia... favor us about your ghosts.
where's the car?
i thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how i turned out.
this is about sex, not like.  mom, laura's here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  you want a muffin?
i accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *i'll* tell you why we were in tht room. because mr. taylor, a respected citizen of our state, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
wow!
i bathed him, didn't i? i fed him and cleaned up after him! if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, i did treat him with loving kindness, and i'm not ashamed to say it.
i'll be back ...
time for you to get off, ma'am.
now can i tell?
and what makes you so tough?
the guy just sold the property. they're gonna build condominiums and i don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
why'd she run away?
no, she's fine.
you know something?  i actually never think of that.  i gotta get some coffee.
what if i say shove it?
let's go after him!!
it was jan, and it was a long time after--
i guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
no. you said i. i killed them.
did... you... get... him?
i got sent.
why not?
i wouldn't know. just do it somewhere else. there is such a thing as good manners.
we been sitting here an hour.  i've peed three times already.
wait a minute . . .
at-at-at-at-at.
yup.
you're not a failure, dick.
i've never seen anyone killed before.
i am not a virgin, doctor. i was married for twenty three years, two daughters. i even have grandchildren... surprised? it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother. my children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. i think they tell their friends that i've passed on. and don't tell me i'm making up for past mistakes doctor freud. 
one more thing. mah wife's got this leather satchel. it's black, about this big. i need ya to bring it back. it's real important. sentimental value... any questions so far?
the witness is leading him.  sustained.
my cars. and a comic book.
sun...
what?
what about night?
somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  he <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  how he was born a magician.
can you give her something?
you sure you want to go through with this?
it's illegal.
he is a porter. he wants to carry them.
i'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. what's his name?
daniel. listen i'm afraid there has been a big--
that's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
and if you just happen to wash out, i won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female senator?  and please note i did not identify any one in particular.
i don't know why i'm so scared, joe.  is it something awful?
ask them to sit down, mr. bernstein.
what is that?  a handkerchief?
for what?
except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
harry.
then...when did she get better?
have they got midge up there?
as to that, i don't know, charlie... we hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
that's why i came to see you, sir. it's that clock-maker's turn again.
cold?
you know, you never told me why you left the army.
both.
i suppose all this is leading somewhere?
that's pretty good.
oh, no, alvy, please. alvy, please.  m'mrnm.
i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
please--
well, good. woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
good work.  really.
ten years, i think. what i miss?
weapons storage...
he is not himself -- but he lives. he is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
i flinched.
i don't think she's such hot stuff.
absolutely not. they are for my private use only.
i... i wish i could, enid, but i really can't right now... i -- it's just that i --
and what did he say?
how're they getting into the u.s. mint to use the presses?
okay.
my reserves are exhausted.  i must have the gems that power my suit.
i just told you.
well give me a reasonable explanation
we're all set,  sir.
so you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
with her? how?
take it easy, dude.
why?
beautiful specimen.
can i see your hands?
mike... in my...
me?
you wanted to be partners with me?
he looks strange, doesn't he? like a baby that just learned to walk.
take it easy, pop.
oh, yes! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
what's the matter?
that <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  nightcap?
what was it, kid? smack? angel dust? don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
miss peterson, his technical assistant.
last i heard, his mother was going alone.
scottie, scottie...
that was great.
half the house! you'll never see a penny. i want it here, in my hand.
alright sid, over there is the stab 3 production offices. that's where sarah darling was murdered last night.
program name?
tired?
barney? why should i? never! we have nothing in common. hmmpf, barney! what effrontery!
funny how things turn out, isn't it?
"to my honey i'll croon,
when i think you're ready.
for going to school?
that's my girl!  did you...?
all right, let's say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying.
she giving you any carfare for the ride?
how much did you pay?
they're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
"elliot"?  the heroic goddamn fireman?
hi.  everything's all right now. we're here.
this isn't mine. wait, where is that kid?...
he came tearing around the corner, out of control --
they tortured us.  and you're going to let them have all that money?
what happened?
we haven't implanted it yet.
i wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
no. i only saw his back. he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
the parkers seem like nice folks.
the ships?
clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  hello?
that's too bad.  ian's got a good thing going over there.
okay.
no such thing, old buddy. it's a one way ticket. once we cross that border, we're on our own.
i'm not gonna throw you out, bernie.
no.
oh yeah, what's that?
hey, you know what i really think?
he'll keep calling.
yeah, roz.
i'm trying terribly hard.
you’re a long way from home...
you have to stop doing that!
you broke your promise.  you talked to her about me.
david, cut it out. mark davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
excuse me?
that's it, everybody out.
who?  who?  who?
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --
me?!  it's not me, it's god who makes everything complicated!  if he's all-powerful, why not let the english stay on their island in the first place?  and why let this war go on for a hundred years?  and why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  why, why?!
i don't get it. why didn't you go for it just now?
that boy's one in a million. a real tiger.
where'd you leave 'em?
you'll be sucked down too!
she don't put in at cresap's landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. come on in and have a cup of coffee.
here, in case you think of any ideas.
perhaps... you're right. i've certainly been busy. with the kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the saunders trial all falling at the same time...
blessings on thee, the both...well... gotta run now.  see you two kids later!
what's wrong?
excuse me.
david... please...
yeah. i sure know that. yeah, but how many more are out there?
how much closer would you say you were?
let's go.
son! -- out of the water now!
yes?
why can't you talk to me?
i know that, sir.
so i hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
yeah, and i know ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... i wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
it's stupid, of course.
you an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. we're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. if anybody says to come dance--why i'll say you're poorly. but you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
everybody needs money. except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. people like that.
i know. he's just the best.
not taken.
i'm meeting someone.
i see a ring on your finger.  you have any kids?
all right! now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are d. b., was trying to use that to shove his way into the white house. so he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. what would you say about that? huh?
then suppose you give me the money. four hundred and fifty dollars.
wow.  you two really have something going, don't you?
what?
first offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  the piggy bank.
hey.
peeperman? wrong? what color was it?!!!
morpheus, the oracle... she told me --
what part of russia?
you missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
that proletarian! in the old days we'd have had her flogged.
kid? the kid's shootin at us?
not tonight you can't. want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
so we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
no, you give me a break! i never left a source hung out to dry, ever. abandoned. not 'til right fucking now! when i came on this job, i came with my word intact. i'm gonna leave with my word intact. fuck the rules of the game! hell, you're supposed to know me, mike. what the hell did you expect? you expect me to lie down? back off? what, get over it?
i'll come right to the point, doctor.  your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of national security.
our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
if you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, i'd probably be pissed.  boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
we're going right ahead with--*what*?
oh dammit, i love you!  i can't eat, i can't sleep, i can't think, all i do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
but in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
sure do.
i made the plume from a quail feather.
sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  i have no complaints with that, in fact, i was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. it says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
i see.  and this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  a sort of retroactive abortion?
you know, i don't think so. i'm confused but you know, i don't think he'd ever hurt me. i don't think he'd hurt anyone.
marsh's cardiologist told me that after marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
my god! what happened?
painless, you mustn't talk that way. it's a lot of crap. cover for what?
animal, vegetable, or mineral.
it took me an hour to clean it up. that was not in my head!
you can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
i am?
i'm well aware of this asinine article.  and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
we missed.
i think we're getting a little off the subject here.
i hope it turns out you're a whitefoot, alex -- i could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
what the heck were you thinkin'? heck, if i'm only gettin' bank interest, i'd look for complete security. heck, fdic. i don't see nothin' like that here.
...i can't do it, wally...
just keep leading the way.
and what if amateurs try it?
well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
think, hannah. does james have any friends. i mean, besides you and... me?
you look exactly the same.
i have to be honest with you, ted. i really despise "the girls of xenia."
yeah. i suppose you people will crucify me for something i didn't do.  i didn't! you understand that! ... i didn't do it! she -- tried before -- 
shoulda got an apartment.
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one.
we're using esper -- a 231 -- that picked up holden's alarm.  its guess is that all five are in the city.
what i mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if i came back... do you think you could forgive me?
you don't say any more'n you have to. you say, 'well, i'm glad you assholes stopped by, so i can set you straight.'
he's lining up talent for hal phillip walker.
he doesn't have one.
no.  we decided that we're friends.  i mean, i know it's a terrible word...
oh, well, you know frederick.  one of his moods.  although it wasn't a bad week.  he  uh, sold a picture.
i'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
zero's a number right?
good morning, major.
steve, i...
yeah. the boss sent me over to offer you a job. he wants you to write a daily column on the tribune.
peters is right, no one's here.
who are you?
twenty thousand.
almost quaint.
she great or what?
how'd you get this number?
i had a feeling you would say something like that. so i brought us dinner.
you were not dead before. when i thought you dead, i did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that i would never see your face. i saw our end, and it will come.
here.  the hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
...hit smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, mr. president.
did you hear what i just said -- do you have that?  take a breath.
yesterday that might've meant something.  pull me off.  you'd be doing me a big favor.
make an appointment.
no, treves, it's out of the question. now if it was up to me, i'd say "certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," i'm sorry, i simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
i'm not here.
'it got us in hot water...we should have been there for carla....'
what are --
he was watching letterman, huh? sneaky, that chili palmer.  so, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
no, i can’t. we’re late for a dance lesson. i guess you’ll have to finish up later.
the fbi, and the cia, and j. edgar hoover and oil companies and the pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the white house?
what are you going to do?
considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
yes, sir.
no, really?
yeah.  it was.
you're really cramping my style here.
relax, don't jam it...
my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel. deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
they stop the construction work at six or seven. the parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. even the early geeks don't get there before five.

i thought you hated those people.
if freddy's loose, i mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  another age?  another form?

that ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in san pedro. there was this ensign...

as i remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. must run in the family--you wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
thank god!
yeah. 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.

oh, i don't know. i mean look around. isn't this a fun place?
eve?!
i didn't know -- i had no idea this was your apartment --

thank you.
forged papers! now, what?!

in every exhibition room.  the museum's divided into five cells. the reception and exhibit are in cell five.  we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
how much money do you have in your pockets?
no way. this would just provide some stability is what i'm saying. i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
you said you could help.
my brother harold was about the same age as those kids, john.  tuberculosis got him.
your bookie?

i really thought he would show up. i waited... and waited... and waited...
what can you say?
maybe forty, maybe not that much.

things happen? what the fuck are you talking about? they did something to us, frank. we have to expose this.
what is the condition of the bridge?
add it to the list.
you ever use it?
all right. i'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
mr. langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. cpr. i've never said this before, but frankly i thought anthony was dead. the veins in his face were all sticking out. his skin was blue. he truly did look dead.
why shouldn't i?
so they can have their hamburgers!
it's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. the part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. they didn't know about it back in the sixties. even now, it's not understood very well.
you want to get him? find something he wants. get him to come to you.
kaufman, i'm going to need information on mr. chauncey gardiner's background.

you know the main staircase in the opera?
you know something? i’ve just seen so much ugliness i don’t think i’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  i’d hoped to have a private word with adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter.  i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
this is his stuff.  i've been out in the cold all day.

you got pug killed! you tried to get me killed! you just lost your get- outta-jail-free --

a blue one, ok. and it's still there.
frank.
hi, ray.
you just feel sorry for me.
long gone... marvosa well you won't mind if i don't take your word for it, right?
it's too neat. things ain't that neat. it makes me mad. that somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. don't that piss you off?
that macho pompous english --
well. he said to "make the house mine."
he's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
i don't care motha fucka. i'll bet you money she fucks me.
your majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as ambassador.  but i would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the emperor, if i did not say that it is entirely possible that the emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the treaty of tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a french alliance for an english one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
what the  --  !
our habitat, i mean.  this place can't handle another attack.
i know what it is. she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. inside there's a silvery ring...
shows how much you know. it's something about tomorrow.
no.  you are mistaken.  prince albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  i asked what was wrong with my son.
and having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. you're spineless.
you're groping.  i have been fair. it's my move now.
let's stop in sandusky, hawk.
all accounted for?  where's penny?
not tonight?... you're not driving up tonight?
you don't wanna hurt your back.
you look like you could still be in high school.
shelly was skimming from the business. he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out. he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
one shirt - blue, collar attached.
i've heard of it happening.
it's all right, chet.
they'll want more than your word for that.
you know, i'm pretty expensive. i get five hundred a week.
jesus.  they look like the secret service.
i told you not to go into that racket. you could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
"row, row, row your boat..." i love "row..."  do - do you know "row, row, row, row, row your boat?"
debi rutlege.  female.  caucasian. twenty four.  worked over at the four oaks hotel.
... and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
some people.
well, i should probably get going.
how's your mother feeling?
laser fail-safe. you can't get the code wrong... it slags you. i can't let you try it.
i wish i had that luxury. i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can't go, because you won ' t.
you let me worry about him, okay?  personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, rennie. you made the right decision.
i love writing. a-anne rice? i love anne rice.
what are you talking about?
oh, not at all, i let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
what is that?
okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' mallory? i know she's still here, and i know you know where. so, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
relax.  i got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
why do we need you? you only come between us. we can be the smartest person in gotham city. we want the empire for ourselves. time's up, laughing boy.
too late now.
no... nothing at all.
how recently?
he's shut out the communication circuit!
might be from tallahassee. but i'm not sure yet.
come on you pansy!
yes.  like that.
how do you know?
you'd never get away with it. besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. it's christmas. there is one more option.
not necessary, but preferable. i don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
butch called.
ah, your new head shot...  i like it, very much...
you're not listening. he isn't better. he gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
maxine...
fifteen.
what?
guess i don't.
you don't seem like no fag...
exactly what i was --
probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
hi. pat bateman. nice to meet you.
i don't know.  it's hard figuring you two as brothers.  seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
how come you're so brave with all this stuff?
see? and these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- i didn't want any of them. you... you're what i want. understand?
the well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
what do you mean, "good looking?"
no, i'm not. we were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "jew."
i'm sorry, ma. but--i didn't know what i was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. i didn't even know i was gonna do it.
hey, brad... how's it going?
i'm in trouble.
we went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
the test is this monday! 15 megatons... let's see, we need 4200 rads...  you'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... you realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
you've got her? where?
so did we.  i sent him to franklin and erie.
because i'm in love with you.
i guess it depends on your perspective.
a coin's got two sides.  when you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
right.
it sounded like a pick-up line.
beverly, i've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
i don't want to go.
then let's assume i don't.
i don't really have any problems.
yo, teach, what the fuck?
you do not know what you are saying!
ain't seen you in a coon's age, johnny.
four nights. how did you sleep?
ah, cats. now and forever.
sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but i'm in the computer room, and i think i've located the malfunction. the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the emergency air lock. can't pinpoint it exactly, but i'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
put our people on the scene.  smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
i'm - i'm hearin' things from security. they're all ex-cops. the sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. they want to put you in the black book.
i'm glad i didn't have to kill you.  i'm glad it didn't come to that.
i don't care about luck, you understand me? it ain't that.
from basketball.
yeah.
after you drop the kids off, take micheal home. put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
did i ever tell you about my son, jerome?  he's a big fan of yours.  he wants to apply here.
you're carrying too much money on you, hank. you better turn some in tonight.
i mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
what's the best thing i can see tonight?
try me.
oh - oh, poor dorothy!
i don't think so, thea. he has spoken of your mother. i don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
where?
maybe i should go home and grade papers. owwww.
devil his due.
he blames you for everything that's wrong about me. thinks you raised me stupidly.
is that right?
mel's doing some business with me. it's nice to do favors for people you do business with. he was in a hurry. no big deal.
what's up with you? bladder infection?
why don't you ask eddie?
we want to frighten you away.  so that you'll move out.
i understand. the person who sent me wishes to help you.
...like it never even happened...
anything from the bank?
new star.  hey, guess what? i got a new star on the readout.
it's not bad, it's ok.
for any movie.
baby, i was gonna give it to you.
what about the last of the big-time spenders.  you make him?
no.
since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
sir, before you boot me, i just want to explain.  i mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
you're the one who should be in politics, john.  you're tougher than i am.  you never crack.
oh, could you, mr. webster ?
what is your name?
where'd you get this, darling?
naw, man. they just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
i cut your new orders personally. by the end of the month, you'll have your first command: uss excelsior.
you did this? to yourself?
...excuse me.
he doesn't like it.
man, this guy is really good.
what?  how about a drink?
it does. feels right.
you bitch -- where the fuck are you?
you would?
totally -- you were being very, very bad.  you went up in the plane and jumped out.  you had a parachute, but it didn't open.
john anderton was my friend!
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
i'd like to spoil him just once. sure you don't want me to go in with you?
oh, peter.
that's a "j."
your call is come through.
well?
why did you do that? scrape off your hair?
how do you feel about that?
where?
why is that impossible?
i will relay the message.
six million dollars.  i'll give you the same.  but i want the complete list now, not just eastern europe.  i won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  i want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
my name is gina!
you okay?  kelly?
zukovsky...
jacob, what can i do?
did you get my money?
always, baby.
go inside at once.
you can do it from up here, captain.
a million things could have caused those problems.  poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  our offer is final and more than fair.
you must not look to me for help. your brother is no longer my problem. he is now your problem, conway.
they're fucking yeshiva buchas. you didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. you knocked out a guys teeth.
okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
some or it.
still quite a hike to devil's cauldron.  days.  a long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  you can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
i'll get it back next time.
i was with max when he got the call.
you can go back to bed...or lois might let you go swimming.
it will take years to make that many statues.  but your work would be featured.
you'll be better off without me. i ain't fit to live with no more. it's just like a lynchin'. maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
importation value?  at twenty-two thousand a ki...
right behind you.
milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. most don't have one.
please go and tell your master that we have been charged by god with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the holy grail.
dade?
yes.
sorry, babe. sorry. it would have made a swell story. i just got carried away. that's too bad. so he proposed to you, huh?  what a twist! you set out to nail him - and he—
coming?
i'm so glad you two could make it. mirtha, look at you.  so beautiful.  you look like you're about to burst.
i wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but i guess you are.
i'll be by saturday to pick him up.
bob was a grown man.  in any great struggle, there will be casualties. wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  project "mayhem."
sorry, charlie. i gotta get my johnson worked tonight.
i notice you've sub-divided your b coupons. feeling a little light on principle?
althea hasn't told you?
look, man. i don't care if you're putting from the rough. there are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; alexander the great, caeser, shakespeare, oscar wilde, napoleon, gertrude stein, not to mention danny terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
my dad.  no question.
yeah, she's here.
uh-huh.
trials aren't only about truth, mr. hooks.  even though they should be.  they're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
me? no, i think it's kind of a stupid game. i mean, at least, i could never get into it. i tried it once.
you told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
sexual tension...
ok. maybe i'll see you later. thank you for your help.
and uh, your nicotine sir
what the hell's his problem?
uh-huh.
you were in the war?
i put in for a replacement for you but no one...
yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
i've been meaning to ask you, mrs... ummmm.
postmortem?
now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the saxonia are so obvious...
how certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
the fifth room is your broadcast room.
i said i'll think about it.
you okay, man?  i mean, what just happened.
what's more important than sanitation?
fuck you, phil.
i don't know, i'm just so depressed. everything is just so... depressing.
why?
i know you're not.
so, <u>neil</u>.  how's it goin'?
in your opinion.
we're leaving in three hours.
i don't know, but under no circumstances would i talk about it here.  i want you to go home and relax the best you can.  continue your life as if nothing has happened. that is very important.
sir, i ran the 220 in high school.
yeah, that's right. so now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
speak up boy!
you're thinking: okay, there's no want ... but they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
oh will! i was wondering when you'd call.
general lee is detained captain...
you don't want cancer?  you're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  gimme the cigarette.
first you tell me.
wait or act.
hello ray.
...sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? you've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
nevertheless what'? kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
awaiting my orders.
what do you want?
want to come out?
yes i feel it in my bones.
how long were you married?
dear heart, i love you.
come here.
no.  i'd seen him in there a few times before.  he was just a punk.  i'd never like danced with him or anything. anyway, he was a thief.  he must've taken it from the statue.
no.
dead.
my mind was not playing tricks. he was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
martin...i want you to know some- thin'...
worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and i was mad for her. but i knew it was hopeless -- so i decided to end it all. i went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to eden park -- do you know cincinnati?
where's your program? won't it miss you?
hungry, anyway.
you're not using it today?
but we were so careful.
back off, just go away you klutz. alright, here's the story. the items in these cases belong to me. i designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
leave.
laugh it up.  you'll cry later.
uh, actually, i tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
look, i thought we were all right on this, maura.  it's over.  you know that.
have you ever made it with a girl?
oh my! 
pretty good. sure was surprised to hear from you. you talk to bill?
what can i do to put you at ease? shall we begin like david copperfield? i am born, i grow up. or shall we begin when i was born to darkness, as i call it. that's really where we should start, don't you think?
are you sure –
that ghost mask is sold at both kroger's and walmart. neither of which keep purchase records.
taste this.
why are you mad?
bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... in fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  that's if she can learn to bake.
listen.
linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
which flowers did you order?
going north?
well?
he never ate the pre-nup, did he!
there are agency regulations about this.
my uni-net account.  i log on.  the program's there.
your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. what do you think of that? i can't get a job now.  you bastard. you're no different from matt. a pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
alright.  well, that's something new.
i can still feel its weight. if you could have felt it, not just seen it...
coney island??
sorry.  now if it was hunt you were interested in--
not to my knowledge. privacy is a great concern to my customers. but, if you say this is an fbi matter...
something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to el paso, rudy?
admiral, the enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. she needs testing, a shakedown...
you mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
the name?  for the certificate.
hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
i've seen you before. i like your paintings a lot. your hair was different.
since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter s and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in america after all, can be a very expensive proposition ethan.  so, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
put that shit away, they're here.
they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
i detest serpents.
as jesus was. jesus was also a hebrew.
yes.
nothing wrong with being a waitress.
what?
what are you talking about?
i was nine in the sixties.
<u>laurie</u>! shut your mouth!
why?
you've kicked over the whole city hall like an apple-cart. you've got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall. you've put one administration out and another in. this isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! and you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! still a doll-faced mugg! that's all you are.
excuses are like assholes, taylor - everybody got one.
i represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
hello there.
all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
now what happens?
sure i'll speak to your class. but i'm a hard man on women. you want to know why?
-- it hasn't been two years --
that's hard to believe. the two of you seem so different.
of course.
you want the details?
baseball?
well, what're your ideas on these guys?
are you sure they're here?
i see. well, shall we start with the engine room?
teenagers are weird. and you're the weirdest.
i don't know, dignan. you went crazy.
you see? you have someone to live for.
he's not here.
get out of here!
five hundred.
it's important.
close your eyes.
i don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
if you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
yeah? what do you do with 'em?
oh, adam, don't ever leave me alone.
don't read it - sign it!
it's a precaution...  why don't you run down to the bay. they got a swimming float.
oh, so now you know him?
why are we stopping?
i can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. i distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. jane mckenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. i've been after it a long time.
then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
we're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
what's going on?
you got a chisel round here?
we will assume full management of the colorado lode - of which you, mrs. kane, are the sole owner.
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage?
no buts.  took a lot of heart to take that charge.
well?
it says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
what were the yards like?
he was afraid of himself.  he tried suicide once.  he was ill.  manic depressive.  he had wild emotional highs and lows.  not a happy affliction for a scientist.  he'd been revered in our community.  by the end he was a joke.
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy.
do you have a soul-mate?
don't have to call me 'sir' neither... nor grampaw neither...nor methuselah neither...i can whup you to a frazzle.
oh, honey... what happened?
i hate the beige one.
sorry, mr. gekko.
sometimes i get a ride with my brother. but he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
no drinks . no movie. this is the last time i take a charter flight.
hurt feelings department.
no, i don't have the right.  you're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
what did you do to yours?
i was kidding.
this was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
i'll get a dewars rocks... 
i guess you knew that, anyway.
maybe eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
alright, personalised flight care from corey.  books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
i'm going to the hen house. are you coming with me?
hot!
what's wrong?
you must be wrong, mr. connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the john doe clubs.
i want to rent this one.
terrify me?
who, me? oh, no! don't bother about me! we're not hurt! isn't that right, skipper?
let's say... for instance... i want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches i like?
pardon the hour, sir.  but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way.
you may feel more comfortable. this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
i want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the oakland police department. the fbi doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. as i've said before, agent rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
siddown, take off your coat. you want something to eat? we gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
to hide it from the i.r.s.
the recovery? oh , yeah! hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
what?  oh as <u>if</u> i'm interested.
of course.
you think it killed . . .  yeah, i guess not.
captain pierce, would i be imposing...?
i'll talk to you later.
you kidding? this is detroit. drink?
thirty-five bucks.
i knew it. he's finally retiring.
but i feel like— my friends won't talk to me.
what caliber is my gun?
we can't.  the storm.  the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  and we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
oh god, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
holy shit.
it's a brassiere. you know about those things. you're a big boy, now.
that we're going back.  i don't want it to end.  i don't want to be what i was when i left.
what the hell are you doing here?
no... but i found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
it's one thing for kids. you get older, you nhave other things.
uh...over easy.
i need you so much! i love you!
we don't crawl at hudsucker industries! get out of my office! leave your uniform in the locker room!
why, i'm assisting you, sir.
all right, gentlemen! we will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
okay.  look, if it helps, bud hates himself for what he did.
i want you to take this... to remember by.
i want the money back i've thrown into this rubbish heap.
could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
oh, it's even more wonderful then.
mine?
... and then i opened the door again but it was gone.  there was nothing there.
see what we can do to donna?
kinda pie y'got?
i don't believe i've seen you at any of our services before.
rockville center.
what are you, my father?
huh huh huh huh huh huh.
of course, commendatore...
make the one you want.
i was just telling the woman how i feel, for god's sake.
she’s not a girl anymore.
i'm taking over the center seat. i'm sorry, will.
didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
no, just - just give him, give him ten. that's it. ten.  i'll be right down.
look, if you don't let me out of this... i'11 just... i'11 just sit in my apartment all day. i won't go anywhere, i won't do anything. what kind of show will that be?
think of your health, max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
you nitwit! i worked for three years on this deal!
dating anyone?
you are not so sure that he'll come.
so this other guy?  he's a terminator too, right, like you?
dad, i'm going to jail and you know it.
i don't think starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
i mean, follow orders, sir.
you soundin' like the old man now.
well -- this would be goodnight.
people get tired.
yes but i was a boy. and i still had hell to pay.
they weren't my shoes.  mine were too small.
you speak english!
didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
that's right. so, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
don't be so sure.
yeah.  and you used that. used <u>me</u>
if i could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
i don't know...
it works.
haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
that seems a shame. the night is young.
well i brought something, i wanted to show you.
they will.
i tell you she's mine!
i don't hate you.  i need your help.
... yes???
that's nice. all we have is a japanese beetle trap.
not if my tron program was running. that would seal the system off. if your file's in there...
i'm clean.
how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
and that's a <u>good</u> thing?
that was very interesting. thank you, rose.
like, that there's a point? an organic connection between all living things.
not a lot ta know.
why do you call him that?
what?
stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
i have 6 tons.
no, in your...ear piece. you have a lovely smile . can you hear me now?
watch it!  move back.
well, now, where's everyone run off to? frank?
the websters.
i hope so.  but that's up to the guy upstairs.  upstairs...  ...hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
nice? he's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
don't worry!!!?   you've got it!!? are you crazy?
he's got a real taste for it now. and he's getting better at his work.
<u>we</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  maybe cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
yeah, but he told you things.  he never told me anything.  even though i was the oldest. it was always you two, running off, doing things together.
have you come from my brother?
fat chance. you know, lee wilkins came to hear me last night. he told me to forget it. you told me to forget it. my parents tell me to forget it.
does it look okay?
i had it impounded.  come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
it'll never be over, will it? look at me, i'm shaking. some legend, huh?  you must be pretty disappointed.
the stealth eagle is about to fly.
whew! that wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
i preffer to stand.
what do we have, malcolm. a broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. we don't even own our own home. what about our children? what about me? you don't even own life insurance.
he drank it hot?
i understand. thanks for letting me crash here.
it's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. you may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, mr. merrick. it is lights and music, gaiety and joy. it's... well, it's romance.
i'm home!
hey!  you're not eatink.
i just wanted to see you.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
how you feeling?
okay, but what if it's like foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
picture it... i feel like i gotta share this with somebody.  it's too perfect.
why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days i'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
slider -- they let you into top gun? if you're among the best in the navy, i tremble for the security of this country.
you ratted on my mother??
every novel i've had published in every language i've dedicated to lucy.
look!
there’s a guy on 81st and madison. you get your results in 24 hours.  do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
have you talked to triplette?
to yourself, that's where.
good god, marquise --
he's still asleep.
maybe i'm just fucking curious.
when?
i'm not upset.  why would i be upset?
that angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
your... lover?
were you with him this whole time?
stuttering stanley! stuttering stanley!
somebody has to.
oh, sure. a variety of weapons.
how'd you do it?
she fucked me too.
far from it.
tom? you can come on. they gone.
well--no. i didn't. why?
...that's an old one.
this much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. it's got to be smuggled.
we're going back to nature, you and i. i'm going to retrain you. i'm going to make you free again if i have to kill you doing it.
what are you doing?! get on with your misery!
what are you researching?
why are you here?
he's grubbing for money, father.
giving up?
walter. when i fill out my 302, do i say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
so, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
you're not english.
oh, dear. his high exaltedness, the great jabba the hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
so, you divorced of what?
save it, i already took the tour.
sure.
i'll destroy them when we get back to paris.
i bet you he'd know how to say it all right. and me, i get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but i never get right to it. do you know what i mean? so the only chance i've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
mookie.
julia?
is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
you're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
don't worry about it.  if the network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a marine gunboat from powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  they can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  all we've gotta do is sit tight.
par away, long ago glowing deep as an ember
did you kill her?
thanks, clark, but i'm booked for the night.
snow's to their advantage, kid. you can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. wise up.  take me to the yukon. i'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
all right.  who are you?
no... go on.
i didn't know which side you were on.
you've lost it, aim. you've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from dubuque --
maybe after we get done with him i'm gonna buy us some girls.
who?
oh, i'm fine, i'm wide awake. what's up?
now you know what i know.
water on arrakis!!! i have seen this place in a dream.  a treasure.
okay, well, then, i'm gonna break new ground.
what do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
suppose not.
here's your jacket!
and joe ramage - do you remember him?  he comes and helps out in the shop.
you'll have to pack quickly.
i work in a shitty video store. i want to go to a good video store so i can rent a good movie.
what are you doing?
any contestants worth mentioning?
what are you doing here?
where are thomas and fedens?
why did you call me?  the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you.
i don't care about money.
sollozzo knows mike's a civilian.
how'd you know i was in here?
have you thought about this?
tom, i've got something real big for you.
this may be hard for you to understand... but i'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
who's there?
the harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, i suspect, is the emperor. -- thufir you will make a formidable duke!
i thought you were getting me a drink?
the phone company was broken up.
jerry--
were you in nam?
thank you.
have you never been caught in a similar situation?
i'm sorry. i couldn't help it.
go ahead...if you want to. it doesn't matter.
all kinds of things. making plans.
you idiot!  asta! stop that!  get down!  now, stay there.
evelyn... get up... now!
where's the money hid.
later.
okay ... how about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
looks like we hit pay-dirt. this place is crawling with them.  see the valets over there? they're vampires. so is the doorman.
yeah, he'll really go for that.
that be so, better you pinch yourself now, jack.
listen -- all i really want is an estimate.
the message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  it's smart.  it's approaching us in a simple way.  like you would a dog.  holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
why not?
do you want to sit there, jeff?
the name will live forever.  it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia.  mhravitch.
not a prayer.
we don't know.  whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
it wasn't a lie.
you're on a budget from now on.
it's not going to be forever. i figure three years is long enough. i can see it the music pans out.  and right after graduation we should start seeing other people. kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. know what i mean?
spas t. raikin, a leading member of an anti-communist group.
what the hell do you want me to do?!
well... is it loaded?
what kind of law?
...i began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on horn island.
what in the goddamn hell are you doin'? it's the middle of the night.
you did it, kirk!  damage report, ensign.
that mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
someone else coming?
...but i guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, miss archuh?
that's true.
because of what i'm betting.  my life.
what happened?
that was weird. i guess leaving was the best idea.
i didn't kill officer harrison.
oh, god...
charlie!
yeah, i know what your saying. and i'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
it's a simple thing.  everybody gets them. all we gotta do is call an exterminator.
a man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, freddy voice.
you say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
you two fucks listen up.  doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit technothugs.
let's concentrate on my smarts. pierce patchett made you, didn't he?  he taught you how to dress and talk and think and i am very impressed with the results.  but i need some answers and if i don't get them, i'm going to take you and patchett down.
-- nothing i can do about it unless you're suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties -- which i'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the constitution.
and that's how you use the lapd choke hold.  now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
don't you people get it?  we're in the 21st century.  slavery was over four hundred years ago.  all that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  let's all grow up.
hello... i'm sorry i can't talk to you right now... i suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. what is your name?
that sounds like me.
does the threat board show anything?
you know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
here you go. 
where are you going?
then prove it. lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission . . .
when you've lost as many years as i have, love, puts things in perspective, know what i mean.
you know what i've been doing since i got home? been working on a poem.  it's about you.  sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so i write 'em.
yes, yes. they were very sincere about it too. you see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. they've never known anything different. so what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
let's forget that we ever met.
andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  you are the king of negative energy.
there are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
what about this x-ray vision of yours?
has he been refusing food?
leonard, listen.  i need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  look, i'm trying to help you here...
no no! he never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
damn it, why are you ruining my night? i'm just starting to have fun.  well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
let's cancel.
and that is?
doctor crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
you want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
come on, hamilton. you're going over there to represent captain kidd fish and chips. we have stores all over southern california. part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. you know that!
where the fuck is that bitch?
dad, you there?  you okay?
how ya doin' dad?
they're happy like this.
oh.. oh.. oh no?? oh?
peter, what can i do for you?
and you pulled people out? you're...  a hero.
i'm looking for them.
nobody knows.  it changes practically every day.  how much money do you have?
show a little respect, nero.  the man was an important artist.
burke!  open the door!
black capsule.
just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
we're not proceeding anywhere together.
oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  we're just about to start cutting in.  you're welcome to stick around if you want.  it's really fascinating stuff.
oh, no.  no.  no.  i meant no scheme.  i merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  it's just a thought.
everything. this is perfect. the subconscious mind remembers all. you can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
pause as he takes all this in i think your dad would miss you.
i thought so. where's your husband?
i heard.
me neither.  how far is rancho cucamonga?
well, look who's here.
glad to meet you, too.  you are all your father talks about.
sit up, smile, zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
he's making himself a "woman suit," mr. crawford - out of real women! and he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. a dressmaker, or a tailor -
what do you mean?  i'm just doing what we've always done.
oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as i recall it was admiral kenney, the surgeon general of the navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
what business is you in, homer?
hurry up!
mr. gower, i think . . .
you know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
you want to know something? take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
good god, ya'll!
yours... is... the superior...
i'm impressed. i didn't think you could do it. what did you have to do, steal them?
what are your favorite buildings, david?
can we talk?
i don't know. i don't remember doing it.
i can't.  look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  i mean it. for the first time in my life, i got people respecting me.  up in hinkley, i walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what i got to say.  i never had that.  ever. don't ask me to give it up.  i need it.
but your body is in the world, isn't it?  if someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
i couldn't turn you in, not now. i....i know i wouldn't!
but of course yours worked.
time to cut a rug, z!
why would i do that?
you're a basket case.
but...
i've been knocking.  the door was open. is everything all right in here?
oh hello, anne– he types furiously.
why not go to work for me?
miss beaufort has accepted our invitation.  by this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
jacqueline. mr. romari phoned me. she went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
o.k., cowboy.
i've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  it won't explain everything; but indicates where i will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  pop would have given those to luca -- you knew pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  it discusses kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  the men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
we have no radio.
yeah.
i'm lloyd dobler.
you're crazy.
what.
how's loomis?
then what did you want to gamble for? if you'd have beat us out of fifty g's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? well, we want our dough.
is this you?
yeah.
calm down, calm down. shh!
she could be telling the truth.
hey, my plate is full.
it's all right. i'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. the mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  i'm going to need a lot of therapy.
well, that's it. he'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first rem-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
the thirst overcomes him, just like the others. it's not something he can control.  the problem is, time's running out. his body's starting to reject the serum. and so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
that light is not daylight, i know it, i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua. therefore stay yet. thou needest not be gone.
i'm not even a field person.
we've subpoenaed the auction house's records.
maddy's party.
where we goin'?
...and i hear she's richer than croesus.
do you mind if i drink this here?
will that stop the tear?
sir, that's a field job. it's outside the scope of my assignment. and i've got a test tomorrow on -
no problem for me either.  honestly, it's no problem.
what's this about? this is obviously some scam. is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
well i want to leave.
commander skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. maybe he slipped by without checking in.
we'll lose them if they go in there.
who, mr. white?
i plan on getting a lot older. and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
some sort of lead or something.
oh. well i am.
what'd they give you?  thorazine?  how much?  learn your drugs -- know your doses.
what?
ms. heller said not to talk to you.
he told you.
you mean like couples?
who are they?
is there a problem, george?
i'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
johnnie, i can't tell you, honey. is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? we've got to find them kids.
and you said...?
would you rather be dead?
hello.
geoff, dinner's ready!  geoff?!
you ruined the whole thing!
hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  where is your wife?
you want to do this some other time?
you do good work, alice.
she didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  all year.  she didn't even go to the prom.
relax.  j. edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
just like that, eh?
pleasure
and do you think i live on air?
oh. oh, god. of course, dave, how are you?
what are you saying?  this story is too big for this paper?
i'm not trying to tell you he's little lord fauntleroy.
don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
he will be waiting...
i was at home.
-- listenin' to that music so loud: you tryin' to damage your ears?
think it'll do any good?
where's mom?
jesus. the whole damn thing's loaded.
you gave your word?
hey, cheswick! wake up!
i bought a new rug.
come on, what's under this?
what's the matter?
okay, chewie, it's now or never.
according to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. listen, bruce, i don't want walter burns to use me, but i'm perfectly willing to use him. how long will it take to get him examined?
mmmm, no.  not a good idea.
you're late.
hello?
i don't care about the danger, father. i just want to be good. i want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
we thought it was an emergency.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the jewish community.
she had the same.
well, then i do apologize... but what i'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
i do, she's real funny.
will you finally cut it out?  just in case you haven't noticed, i am trying to write a book here.  and maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. so why can't you just leave me alone?
this plane will take you to canada. from there you can fly back to paris.
why?
what are ya thinkin'?
you're late.
"would you like ground pepper on that salad, ms. branch?" remember?
yes.
yeah, yeah, i did.
oh. guess i got the wrong impression.
if we get him, i'll be happy enough.
no.
are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
the movement!
you feel sorry for solaris, or for me?
still --
harry, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
we are far from the hollow.  loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
get up, willa.
how you doing, ms. jackie?
i always wondered what the world would be like.  but now that i've seen it, i don't need to see any more.  it's all right.  once i'm in the tank, i won't remember any of this.
and here's to him. everything in moderation, frankenstein.
oh . . . yeah, yeah. that's all right.
he wrote me a nice deposition. he says he just received the drugs. you did the selling.
i couldn't bear for it to end.
something like that.
wait a minute.  i'll go with you.
julie, you left four messages... four.
he has you on a pedestal.  and me in his arms.
what do you want?
what do you want me to do about it?
hey, man, i can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
asteroids don't concern me, admiral. i want that ship, not excuses.  how long until you can have skywalker and the others in the millennium falcon before me?
well.  sex, i guess.  is sex with him better?
prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
they knew who you were when they broke in your house?

i'd like to bomb their emperor too.  but i think that'd just piss 'em off.  the idea here, gentlemen, is not revenge. we're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  so let's try this again.  military targets only.

they love reed and his inquisition! i think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  it's becoming the american way!
we'll pray anyway.
see, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. but since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. the last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
in any event, i will not beg for mercy.
listen.  i'm not trying to piss you off, see?  okay?  i can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
as a parent, that's my right
seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
i'm getting a trajectory...
then it's time we were heading home. three years is...
why not?

oh -- now look at him!  this is terrible!
she wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
how old are you?
but why, if i'm not hurting you?
no one's trying to buy you, willie. it's important to know why you're telling us this.
snoring.  five, six guys. mumbling... vietnamese.  somebody talking in his sleep.  a toilet flushing.
do you always have to call him that?  the suit? it makes you sound like such a hick.  his name is michael.

he was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.

you said history considers me dead. who am i to argue with history?
a gay senator's son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise? the press'll crucify you and your father. his career will be over and it'll be your fault. but we do this different and you come out a hero.
who is it philip?
yes positively. that's where he was drowned...
do you remember his name?
hey -- whatsa matter?
hey mom. are you sure i can't get any money? just a few bucks.
wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me michael meyers is my uncle?
you don't kiss like that. hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
...the damn thing...
you're stoned.
so did i, once. but i kept coming back, and... i guess i became the thing i feared most.
when you are ready.
well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
brrrr! she must be frigid. there's two things i know about life: one, americans will never take to soccer. two, swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  they're shag-mad, man! let me ask you a question, vanessa, and be honest.
what about the shoes?

i took care of it.
...to big.  the in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
what was it?
well, obviously there's no killing.
quite sure you had no motive?
you don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
i don't know, honey. it's horrible.
is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
the old man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  he has one just like it.
i was so goddamn close, finnegan! so goddamn close to my island... i could almost taste the sand...
kill me...
what are you doing?
oh -- 
so how long am i supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
mr. clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
where'd they take lisa?
don't defend that horse's ass to me.
we're looking for the funniest costume! and the scariest! and the most imaginative! and the best costume of all!
in europe.
oh, i'm straight.  respectable.
very popular, sir.
what? oh, it's very impressive.
they're hauling misery into court.
no?
quitting time.  grab a cold one?
who'd have thought it?  danny "chickenshit" flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
uh-huh. while i was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because i was illegally parked -- so i started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
i wonder.
give me the book.
no thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  if you try that at msu this saturday, i'm pretending i don't know you.
why did you write remember on the wall?
you got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
what is it, norman?
oh, no, i am very happy.  but you must have patience with me... i know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  and i know nothing about men. my papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
oh god.
yeah.
we had the greatest afternoon of my life until adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
well, honey, i don't guess i give a shit. i ain't here half the time anyway. if you want a retard livin' in the garage, i don't guess i care. i've got a good tool box and socket set out there i don't want stol'd. i guess i could take it home with me.
i've brought you some things. i hope you'll like, mr. merrick. i hope you don't think it too forward.
do you see a man?
you upstart!
tommy, we have these...
sorry. dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
help cook?
or arrived with her.
you always were hard to impress.
my dirty undies.  laundry, dude. the whites.
i was saying to quince we won't need --
what did it cost?
paramount is calling.
how should i know?
yes!
you still don't believe in god?
fine.
super's busy -- with your negotiatin' committee.
a lot of it was. i just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
i have to go back now.
you think i'm the white angel?
sister paul?
like what?
told you, did he?
nice to be here.
pooh!  pooh!  best, you are joking.
me. first break of day.
i wish i didn't have to do this, terry.
hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? aw, no, i mean... i mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
you know mom, like in the pool.
no, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
sir . . . if i should accomplish this mission –– i mean –– might i perhaps win my wings? i've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
what are you saying, tatsi?
well... you could always dump her, mr. bebe. teach her a lesson. there are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
i'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. i sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... i sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always otis.
hello?
the oscilloscope's already programmed.
for what?
sergeant west's served for twenty- three years. he's the public face of the modern army.
that's right!  tell him, so i can read it in hunsecker's column first!
oh i know that. how does it go...
how many ways can a man say no.
i always thought you knew it was me.
yeah.
are you all right...?
don't bother.  i'm taking a trip.
looks like quite a way to go...
was i money?
i'm gonna need a full name, stanley.
in what, a romantic comedy?
s'matter?
we'll be half-way down the road with the money.
edmunds?  get in here.  i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
how do you know if they do?
it came from your hip.  under the skin.  you have a bank in zurich.  you remember zurich?
too late for what?
jamie! get away!
it ain't in me.
enough to discern its tenor.
and her fiancé!
you don't have to talk about it.
what're you doin', baby?
i'm not playing a game now.
get rid of him?
eight-thirty.
your family still carries the name corleone, and you will run it like a corleone!
could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
how do you open the damn door?
i'm sorry charlie.
that's all swell.  only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. i've got nothing to do with it.
after we ate, we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. and then... he hit me with it.
sportsmanship! that's my point. june fly, ed? mosquito? which of these? well, what fish do you seek?
i thought it was tremendous.
you tryin' to fuck me?
but i want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  my daughter.
i won't waste your time and catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much already. i only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... let me help you now, and i'll trust you when it's all over.
what ? are you my mother ?
12000 feet.  jesus, i don't believe he's doing this.
oh my god...  you're blushing.
no, it's right he should hear. i'm sick to death of it. we can't do anything right for you, can we?
alan?  where are we going?  you see something?
where is this thing that attacked your wife?
well?  was "vicki" right?  about your difficulty with duality?
still.  all's fair in love and w...
the little people who live in this land -- it's munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  it's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. it's all right now - you may all come out.
what?
i saw it with my own eyes. we've killed an extraterrestrial and...
hang on!
yeah, you did that too.  you earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all i'm saying.
there's no one in there!
that makes his birth sign... virgo! why that's the sign of a little girl!  can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with emperor commodus?
don't worry about him.  think about yourself.
no, i'm...thanks.  i took something.
what would your mother say to that?
i know...  you contruct a weapon.  look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
i...i have no idea, sir.
why not? he has great pants.
you girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
don't pull the green wire.  pull anything but the green wire.
jackpot!  two buckets
how long had that been going on?
assume away!
marcia's living with a singer?
hi.
i know.
that is so--weird that you name your car.
well?
right.  in the middle.  of the floor.
it was full of this awful pink ooze.
frances, you're a movie star now. if you give them what they want, you can get anything.
no thanks, i don't smoke.
thanks.
<u>oh god it hurts so bad</u>!
please keep this passport to yourself, until i make some inquiries, will you, major?
please!
are you out of your mind?
so you must have known fleming... and stanton -
what does this have to do with my testimony?! i told the truth! it's valid and true and provable!
what, are you trying to get rid of me?
great to get away, take it easy. next week, i'll get back to work.
we will.
taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
she's mistaken.
wait a minute.  promise me something.
roach...roach, come on.
no, gee--i couldn't stay here--
his grace is very angry with you.
we have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
and they'd be right. we have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
you're a shrink, doc. aren't i supposed to be able to tell you everything?
did you hear what he said?
i may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! mister o'connell but i'm proud of what i am.
they seemed alright.  bring a little life to that old building.
no!  no, no, no, no!
i've never seen a ministry cheque before.
if he does come in i'm not here... what were you drinking, debra?
i will.
which way are you going?
how careful should i be?
i... we have to bury leon tommorrow...
i'm quite sure i don't know what you mean.
obviously.
you know, a primer.
just so you know, i've overridden the vehicle locator.  i just wanted to talk to you before justice --
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
how are you doing, man?
rescue one -- please be advised ranger walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
dad?
please, sir.
why don't you give 'em a call.
i  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  i thought maybe you know something...  i'm scared.
ouch!!
not the way you’re thinking. the women wanted me there for support. you can understand that.
okay, knock it off.
uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard enterprise with my officers as guests of the united federation of planets?
two guys?
nine hundred. bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. come on, lilly, you don't argue with bobo.
come down to earth. do you think they would dare do anything like that? don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
slow.
max something.  i got no clue where she stays.
they've got something.
well we certainly can't stay here. c'mon.
what's his name?
down front as always.
walter...i can't believe it.
you may not realize it, miss kubelik, but i'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
did it hurt?
you biederman?
thank you, herb.  you're a wonderful man.  you really are. everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the little league.
sure.  you didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  you wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about mitchell.  if i believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
is it real?  you people are sick.
hullo, bob. boys, this here is english bob.
well, i didn't.
pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
nothing, really. she's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
like bogan weather, or bogan times. i thought that was just a saying.
korda escaped.
i don't know doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
out in the woods. three bodies. decomposed. mutilated. beyond recognition.
open the door, vickie.
you're gonna screw up our plan.
where do i find you?
did you tell walter?
oh.  oh.  that's okay.  well.  this uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  i mean, i'm... god, i gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
he isn't to be touched.
what do that mean?
you married that fool, clive, that's what. never mind, you can stay with us.
how long have you been waiting?
we have to talk.
yes, general.  but if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
oh.
thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. i'll give you som antibiotic cream--
longer.
bingo. okay, here we go...  want to help terrance and phillip? meet us for a meeting at gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
how much is there?
but they're all the same.
like valentine and silvia?
you do?  over here?  on <u>my</u> side?
that’s it?  that’s all i get?!  a glare?!
did he ever fail to provide for you?
...and my lover. he was harry.
uh-huh.
then god does not exist...
i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers... and i remembered where they are...
mortals, mortals everywhere. and lots of drops to drink.
it wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  it wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
are you hungry?  wanna get something to eat?
what kind of egg is it?
i can't let you do that either.
i give you my soul...
buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
the lipstick thermal camera?
good weekend?
you tell maggie.
you lie! on ceti alpha v there was life, a fair chance to --
you sound different. is that really you?
i don't know.  he spoke to me last night on the boat. i liked him very much.
engagement ring!
johnny does you favors, kid. you got to do a little one for him once in a while.
and that pose is out too, sunny jim. the new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. anyway, you won't meet susan if you don't cooperate.
and the pennies?
i'm ugly... i'm ugly! i'm ugly!
him? he's a big baby. why isn't he here with you telling me?
well, i was just thinking about this john doe business. why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
well then... only one way to go.
fine. whatever. mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  come, let's return to dinner. close the tank.
hey.  hey, you, listen up --
.          .. spock's tube...
i don't even...what do you mean?  i don't even know what that means.
what's you name?
where are you going?
dawn!  dawn!
where are you?
what happened?
just hangin' out.
what did you say that for, sarah?
fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, i don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
what's this boy got that susie likes?
the rank-and-file in the fbi feel he is fbi, but others feel he is a cia man who knows how to destroy fbi files.
yes -- she did.
liar! tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
vickie, open up. i need to come in.
i hope you don't think me daft. it's important work. it's part of a larger sociological experiment. i'm federally funded.
have you met mr lyle?  he's in sugar...?
are you okay, jonesy?
you what?!  how did you do that?
the address?!
that's happening. and, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
she's from connecticut. she belongs to his stupid country club.
it looks like white's game.
all right!  what'd she say?
you're bleeding.
talk about work? never!
help you.
don't you ever have any problems?
yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
maybe they're mary's.
let me take another look at that ring.
you boosted a 'vette? then where is it?
no. yes. i mean yes, i did. in the times. but... doesn't paul owen still live here?
admittance form is wrong.
and here's sandro.  why don't you two go upstairs and change?
look, harry's not part of this. he's just a sales rep.
oh, mom, it's so ugly.
what are they?
yes, please.  you said he gave a name...
we're not talking about buying a car jake. we're talking about killing your wife. it's thirteen, or it's nothing.
yes, that's the trouble with mothers. first you get to like them and then they die.
i guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
je...sus christ!
no.
you did it for me.
when did you get back?
so, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
hi, eve!
that's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. i'm keeping count. when you get to twenty, i'm gonna sock you right on the nose. as a matter of fact, i ought to sock you right now.
c'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
i think wally will be fine, mrs. worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
let it go...
what city?
wha...
your manager?
she's not here right now.
it's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old unitarian barriers --
poor bastard never knew what hit him. jesus, i almost felt sorry for the guy.
really?
john, i've got to tell you, i think you're about used up.
what you did changed my life.
looting and pillaging, eh?
-- so much for the icebreakers. what're you after, ruth?
i ought to break your damn neck.
i got it mama.
just give me the license, please.
she died right in front of me. why'd she have to go and do that, sailor?
did you call that radio station again?
i don't?
that's why you built this ship?
adam, that's not true!
but we don't have any sea weed.
what he went through in <u>albania</u>...
door to the right. get up and run.
he sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
yo --
it means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
you--a friend to me?
your grandmother?
i don't believe it!
thank you, chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
i said... stop!
yes it is...we did this.  we changed everything.  i've been having bad dreams, johnny. dreams where i die...in the fire.  i was supposed to die in that warehouse.
i want you to see my room. i want you to see all of it.
of course.
what show ?
they've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
in one minute.  you are going to feel so foolish.
because he was my friend.
this is a fine thing. maybe we've missed him already.
gary, how we doing, big stallion?
that's where you live.
leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... i couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... i couldn't breathe, i couldn't stand it.
i'm okay.  please, honey, i can't explain.  don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  i'm on my way.  i'll be back at the house in three hours.  call me from the hotel when you get there
how can i help?
because if you are, you have to tell me. if not, it's entrapment.
have you got a minute?
i mean, what is there to be happy about really? i mean, going to the gym, climbing the stairmaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. sometimes i just want something different, you know?
i'll worry about luca.  you take care of sonny and the other two kids.
duty? i am sorry, duty? duty fucking duty. trouble is, you americans want everybody to live like you. we liberated berlin, major steve, not you. our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture.
not a floater.  only just dead.
well, what do you know.
yes...
she's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle?  jesus, man. it couldn't have worked out better. they're convinced kelly whacked suzie. i can't talk 'em out of it.  we should be celebrating.  this thing worked out just like you said, only better.
it's red, ford.
tina!
oh, no, i can't let you do that.
the machine works.  and vic's gone mister hyde on us --
jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? you must have been rich!
darling, peter says i could stay…
yeah, that's easy for you to do. you never had any talent.
frances.
it doesn't look much like the fish spears i knew back in marblehead..
oh. i thought  that's not it anyway. i know this doesn't make any sense to you, but i just can't turn it off that fast. i still feel something for her.
murphy to epps.
the maple tree and the buick. we heard it.
frank sachs -- melvin udall.
i wouldn't know.
new hat?  jill's up, i see.
yeah.
but there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? is there?
what?
gee, that's sad.  don't that make you sad?
what did--?
are you sure she wasn't there?  maybe she was just hiding from you.
hold me. i'm falling!
a hotel?
ever since phil collins did that mtv anti-drug commercial i refuse everything.
you'll live like this forever. alone.  you were meant to help.  to be with people.  not like this.
gee, that's great. after the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. this will pep him up. have you told him about it?
honey, what if i'm wrong?  what if i just don't have it?
you must learn magic.
i heard you talking. you got fired this morning, didn't you?
sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. aren't you exaggerating a bit, dick? call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
how much do you know?
all i got is being a cop.  what do i do if i'm not that?
two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
but the power source, zaltar.
it helped me realize one thing.
i have thought about you.
but i don't want it straightened out.
okay. i've uh, got some questions, from sue. that she thought might be better coming from me... can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
but did you know i knew you'd know i'd know?
i bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
it's weird. i actually feel good about myself. can we do this again next week?
you think i'm dumb, don't you?
yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
the "crises"?
i'm a salesman.
don't let it pull you deeper!
you didn't tell me that. i thought he already knew.
i'm by way of being a medical myself.
i knew this man. green berets, out of fort bragg. what the hell were they doing in here? you got any answers for this, dillon?
he's harmless.
yes.
on the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the crisis of faith.
i imagine shit needs to be done.
i didn't say that.  your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
shakespeare never said that.
your friend must be misinformed.
struck out eighteen...
or reactivated the first one.
there's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
you know why.  you saw it the other night at the piano.  you turned away from me.
who's herne the huntsman?
you're body's dying. pay no attention. it will take twenty minutes at most.
whatsa matter with you?
no.
didn't mr. marsh also tell you that miss lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to chicago for awhile?
you should be. can i meet this friend of yours?
thank you.
but jesus, pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
route 395. past edwards air force base and about half a mile before a place called the red mountain motel. there’s a dirt track with a ‘closed to the public’ sign. it leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. if you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? but not before, you hear?
and it is guarded by sixty men.
yes.  and people will live in the absence of truth.
...yes.
he wants to reward you... that's why i'm here.
hardly farmers. i've done some checking. all these were in the war. these men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. they are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. if i were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what i would create.
and you saw a shape ahead of you...
nothing to worry about -- i'll survive this.
just give me twenty-four hours. please. someone almost killed me today. people are not being nice lately, and i don't want you getting hurt. i think you're terrific. are you a laker fan?
i don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
it's on national television, barnett.
these look quite fresh.
right, his leg's going now.
mr. mulwray, please.
honey, i don't think this is really relevant to...
i want to get the dog off my bed.
you're with them, aren't you? you're going to bury my movie. they bought you!
them's the keys. all you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' english bob can ride out free as birds.
help, huh? and i don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
mummy has a special technique called "deep therapy."
no!  i'm sick of this...
clenched jaw...
yes.
yea, james.
i've only read about them -- and the new internals.
oh, that's right. she told me to meet her there. that's cabana six?
...everyone has been very kind.
no fuck you!!!
you're absolutely right!
no...
i think i got one today.
rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
may we have the rings please?
you're tired of me. i can tell.
go with him, rose. go with him.
hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
look -- i'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- i'll give you twenty -- for god's sake, will you let me use that phone?
yes...
you should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
like it?
it's crucifying him--!
i don't have a story.
...no...
every cop has a story and every story has a girl. the girl in my story was fifteen years-old. she wore a pink angora sweater -- i can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. i told the police she wouldn't run away, i told them who to look for, but i was just a kid. i sat in the police station crying and crying. my parents took me home. the girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher i'd had. he kept her alive a week before he killed her. the police could have saved her. every time i see a photo of a victim i see her. that's what i want to do. i want to save her.
yes, reverend?
but more or less.
only the heirs were killed.  proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment.
hello, herman, it was a happy landing, i see.
not my jurisdiction. the city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. can you make it that far?
i don't even like turkey sandwiches. what kind of pizza?
...look, you're confused? you need guidance? talk to another writer.
maybe she has.
beware of the puget debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
well... two million readers... i know exactly what they want. chapter one: "a childhood behind golden bars. lovely little princess plays with rasputin's beard."
oh shit.
we can't <u>afford</u> a war.
tommy...
lissen. this wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
yeah.
all i know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. the way i see it, brown here looks guilty.
stephen, what are you doing here?
very well. if you insist on details. i have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. good day, sir.  you will forgive me for receiving you like this?
no, you wouldn't let me.  and i don't want to go...
count it.
what?
yeah, okay, but see, the dude--
that's too bad.  i was hoping you were there.  maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when jamilla shot that biker.
will you please do it my way? you'll get into trouble if you don't. if anybody talks to you, tell them... i do not speak english.
he lies.  he is here to trap us.
jesse, is that your hand?
how much did you take off?
they're going to let that guy die. and you're going to kill me.
course it's a good idea.
go ahead, mr. bartholomew -- i'm listening.
but when john f. kennedy's elected president, men'1l stop wearing hats.
i don't know. i just keep going over and over the numbers.
you can get killed!
yes.
we're being attacked! kill! kill! kill!
this boy from west side, plays tackle both ways. bench-presses 350 pounds. you imagine having that much weight on top of you? pushing down? be hard to breathe. hard to swallow.
what you seek. what all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. but to find it we'll need a starship.
i'll be very glad to show you around, miss...
excellent detective work, sir.  you should have the honor of going first.
i don't want you within two hundred feet.  park down by the lifeguard station.  nobody gets out.
as i said, second of all you're too skinny.  you've got tiny lungs. i still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
let me tell you something about boys.  they're like weeds.  they grow best when they're ignored.
what's the matter?
is she looking now?
huh?!
nothing.
bala, that -- that lake we found -- i think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  that's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
what?
wonderful!  why, if our scarecrow back in kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
i have faced that problem before.
you didn't jump in.
marla...
come on, it works.
with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. why here?
easy! it'll tear right out!
i'd love to get in there.
...babe the blue ox?
i have a better plan.
will you excuse...
me neither, but the upshot is i've got color live-action footage of you and ms hawkins and it doesn't look good.
please! we'll talk. just tell us what you expect.
he looks well enough for a mountebank.
do you mean church of england?
jesus, mace.  back off.
do not lecture me about treaty violations. the federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of intergalactic criminals. it is not i who will surrender, it is you.  on the planet below, i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. if you do not surrender immediately, i will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
sha la la la that ain't no crime.
hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  i mean, i know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, i'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  fuck... motherfucker! i knew this, i knew it.
did you take anything out of those pants?
what do you think?
maybe he's got good taste...i don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
"to announce your fucking presence with authority"?  this guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  he's looking for heat.
real down.
well, not much longer to go.
mm-hm.
you are a hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  he gambles a great deal, and wins.  do you know the cards well?
everything. because after tonight, you will belong to me.
take a look at this.
it pays.
you wish.
how am i gonna sell things if nobody comes by? this stretch of road runs between nowheres and nothin' much.
whacking is not of much use on a farm.
you never gave us a chance...
i don't know. i've been hearing some awful things about him.
it is not stage fright -- it's something more --
you guys'll be using teddy's old space, is that okay?
i don't know.
the radio's on the fritz.
did you find wilhite?
i need a ticket.
no. it's all right. i just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
it killed him... you coulda just used draino. it's cheaper.
i know how you feel -- i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. you know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
i'm sorry... i don't know either. i just don't know.
nobody wants to hurt you peaches!
you're saying... it is a compliment.
i don't trust you!
do you want a fruit plate?
hey. i didn't have the heart to wake you.
we heard it the first time!
i'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
i won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  we'll die in peace.
he's a doctor!
i'm talking to myself here.
you know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  in front of the whole <u>world</u>? frosty, the snow bitch!!
edward... you got it!
what do you mean?
drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
he forgot his money...  my mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
i'm telling you right now, i'm tired of this shit.  there's two billion chinese - let one of them be your partner.
i'm going to be so happy to get to college. i hear at northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
no.
the cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
so i guess a blowjob's out of the question?
what are we going to do?
childers.
take it easy now, terry.
i'll do it, j.j. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  i'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. let me make a living!
you say that like a gentleman.
what is it?
fine.  the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man.
don't get angry at me.  maybe you just need a day job.
people get hysterical enough, they do anything.  look, mr. carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, i got to send you over to the army.
she thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
the what?
in this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
are you out of your mind?
eve.
ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
you know, one day i'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, jeremiah.
you're going to stay here...?
you're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
well, austin, you've stopped dr. evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and agent kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
joel, don't jerk me.  i spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
wrong. answer.
there's a new virus in the database.
but i like to... and i don't smoke that much.
just keep it up.
is it you?
hello, aunt theresa.
aye.
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline's husband.
your memories are repressed. they're trying to break through. relax. try to remember-.
what are those people doing there? what do they want?
you're impossible...
how long have you worked for the agency?
and he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
did you sign up yet?
if i die, then they'll be free. it's getting late, isn't it? i can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. it's warm then it gets cold. jeffrey. i feel it getting cold.
gino doesn't know english, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  he gets right to the point.  both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
that's the rub.
how'd you know he died, he tell you?
i'm a national merit finalist.  i'm on the hi-q team and the math team. i'm in the spanish club.  i'm a thespian.  i'm vice-president of my class.  i'm on the volleyball team.
i don't remember.  maybe.
it's not history.
who else?
yeah, that's what i'm trying to tell you. that chick erica?
they'll be coming for laddie and me, won't they?
help!
"routine," my ass!  ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
i know, i know ... you thought i was dead. that's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of russia, which i should have been - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
you almost sound like that guy from there's something about carrie. ben. ben damon.
well, why should i?
did you worry about him?
why don't you dump it? mail it off. give the fucking f.b.i. a present?
you going to knott's berry farm with him?
they've confiscated all his other stuff. but this one's sorta left over. the registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... what's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
really...
okay.
i'm going in, sandy. i'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
purely personal. i believe you might enjoy one another.
despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return george and gracie to the open sea.
in general. do you take risks in other areas of your life?
you're right, will. any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
that food has spoiled.  that is why it was not shipped to the army.
my god... so it's as i always feared. nothing, leading to nothing.
jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but i never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
he'll be back before curfew.
that bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left radcliffe!
get up out of the chair, richard.
emily.  just kidding.
ah, here. today's news from the other side.
we can fix that, because i can give you -- are you listening?
what's with you? what do you care whether i come or not?
in case of what?
you got it. berkeley?
i guess i'm a little screwy.  maybe i could believe it.  should i try?
glad you could put in an appearance.
i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. they've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
i mean i'm not stealing the fucking car.
nope, not even close. i've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
you use words like that, you might make me mad.
i  have complete faith in you. but don't you go speeding.
no. much bet... i mean, much more sinful than that.
you don't need braces.
tell doucet that.  what was his rehabilitation training?
ms. yin, and mr. yang  aha!
you know what i mean.
leave me alone.
the duck?
no. don't do this.
danny witwer is scheduled for a tour of containment tomorrow --
it's okay, it's okay.
dr. floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may i ask you a straightforward question?
eve. i - i don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. but you did. more to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
it's for people!
we hear.  we were told you were a pezzonovanta...big shot.
i'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
frank.  hey, man.  you alright?
why janet?
screen classics?  hmm, don't know them.
no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what the fuck are you talking about?
. . . i look at you, lenny, and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
maybe you and karl want to go with us?
well, we are trying to ruin his life.
he sells bmw's?
charlie, this is business.
did i miss something?
nobody. i love you, remember?
sorry—i didn't mean to—
yes. he never forgave him for it.
dorota!
you wouldn't understand. i come from great darkness and deep peace
hey the door was open.
wha... ?
let thy spirit
ta-da. so what time is my brother expected back?
madness?
why not?
yeh, luther said you could teach me something.  i already know how to drink.
quick.
yeah.   he's a good man.
yeah.
it came for him.  it waited all this time and it came for him....
i don't know. i'm goin' up to baltimore this afternoon.
the gong rang. the fight's over. calm down.
i'm sorry?
that's right. when i was your age, television was called books. and this is a special book. it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick, and i used to read it to your father. and today, i'm gonna read it to you.
i'll be bait alone?
mmm. part of the master control program?
i'm tired, paul. so tired. i have to rest a while.
i wouldn't be caught dead.  no, it's probably how i would be caught.  the mayor stupidly took cobblepot's bait --
you don't buy it.  okay.  so i still want betty mayfield.  where is she?
a fulcrum release lever!
hi, al!
we can make this work, adam! believe me! i'm very good at making things work!
i believe we're being called to dinner.
how many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, i mean?
uh, i'd rather not say.
who identified the body?
what was the part?
yeah, air.
the tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
and you believe me...?
you what?
we mustn't let him land!
l.a.p.d.
discouraging, isn't it? women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
this prison gives out $400 suits?
what was it we had for dinner tonight?
fine.
i gotta go to little rock.
you don't know where loretta is?
perry como!  you had him!  go back! go back!
my daddy lets me sit on his lap.
i have to leave. tonight.
it's the smoke.
...no...no goddamn use.  i have a son, y'know?
guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
there's always someone out there stalking actors. look at that woman from the commish.
i mean it's late, baby.
how do i get out of here?
time is running out, dana.  soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and vigo's.  well, mainly vigo's.  but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
and you?  why did you lie?  you promised i could be confessed...
i can't understand it! where is he? i mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
yes.  a little girl.
don't you love my sexy body?!
we were gonna grab some food.
that's a heavy sedation.
you "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  typical.  what does this virus attack?  don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  have i ever "developed" a virus?  do i put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? do i inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  wow!  and i'm crazy!
you're not a bit like you were yesterday.
the lamplight.  that's all.
i think we may as well sit down.
but your friend is waiting downstairs.
when he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from vulcan, never to return.
i mean, i am really attracted to you.
uhhh... teeth. teeth.
hi.
bring back some memories, nick?
town records are coming up now.
michael, are you still in bed?
some folks take that natural stuff too far.
bulk... why don't we give mr. peep here a chance to think it over?
queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
oh.
what were they looking for?
listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
i like mary. i like when she comes to visit. i just don't think she likes me.
but, the expectation was ten.  and, in this case, expectation is everything.
the loser is nothing. -- only the princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder. we must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
pity you don't have the character.
what do you want with the pentagon?
juice?
what do the police think?
betty.
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated. in one night i recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the e.u.p. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
it's, uh... beautiful country. i had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. there are no signs.
sure you did.  that's what makes it great.  what it needs is a little more dialogue.
the face decays, the mask doesn't. art lasts, we don't. that's why art's so valuable. it's a little piece of immortality.
you two need a time-out.
then window, let day in and let life out. o, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
i mostly work from home. i'm a composer.
gosh--that'll be something! you know what i better do in the morning?
which is?
how much of a nothing? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
you can help us.
where are you going?
and if that's not destiny, i don't know what is.
yeah, but what an entrance!
i’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
you did this -- in a day?!
well, i dunno.  i mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
nobody ever loved me that much.
just do it, okay?
i'm considering taking a job as a "goofy".
i trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. i trust that you'll do the proper thing.
when i was very young.
do you know it like that? by heart.
what you say your name was?
oh, my god, scooby! i'm so sorry...i'm so, so sorry...
no. but at one point you did repeat something though. a phrase. you must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
and i think better than the ocean. i'm serious!
mr. sim, watch out!  o'brien escaped and could be on his way!
with tears?
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet t-shirt with no bra...
would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
are you all right?
none.
seems not.
looks like someone forgot a camera.
you'll never have another chance to hit me again.  i never knew till this minute -
you're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
now release the brake. and slide the stick into first gear.
i thought it was my turn.
and?
but doug...there's something i want you to know.  you're the best assignment i ever hand.  really.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. did <u>any</u> of them know andy was sick? <u>how</u> did they know? did he tell them? did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? none of this information got to the managing partners. we know that. make sure everyone else does too... and beckett: i want to know everything about his personal life. did he frequent those pathetic bars on camac street?
what about ian?
when you lived with the fairfaxes?
look, i help take care of the place.  you got my check, didn't you mom?
what the fuck can i say? i'm serious, man. what the fuck can i say? thank you... thank you... thank you.
there's only one thing it could be... short range scan.
i would feel nothing about my life? is that what you want to hear?!
what?
father jeremy and deacon john townsend of st. ursula's, and our associate, maya larkin.  secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  maya is eminently qualified.
chief talley is the one who got you out.
you didn't tell commodore norrington everything.
sure i do.  there was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed general ripper.
didn't you call?
despite the academy award?
yes, spock.
easy, pal! i was coming to congratulate you. it ain't easy snatching one of those e-tickets. steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
i'll be.
that's the idea.
they don't even realize they should be frightened.
i knew i couldn't trust you. you told me you were taking me home.
you guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  you know what that makes ya  lollygaggers.  what's our record, larry?
this is too fast.  this is <u>way</u> too fast!
him too.
well...
now i'm going to tell you the truth. i really came in here because i was bored stiff by the party.
that was way back...
plus where's huggie bear?
you know how easy it would be? he won't be anywhere near that mall. pull one more switch, up front. that's it. half-a-million dollars. need help?
there's something dangerously wrong with this ship, elaine.  i know its the wiring. that toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
i think finding you's the smartest thing i ever did, for both of us. you just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder i need to get me hustling in this town. hey!
mary, i swear i wasn't trying to trick you.
the kid. junior.
yeah, basement bingo.
you come from green point? go back to green point. you don't work here no more.  here, kid, here's half a bill. go get your load on.
basically you'd have to re-write the victim's dna, alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
i know.  i go with you.
what difference does that make?
what a pair we are. we deserve each other, don't we?
now let's get this settled—
you haven't got a uniform?
of course you know dean rabin, one of my assistant d.a.s. dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?

no.
i heard he's fucked up.  they're taking him to the hospital.
hamilton, come over here. what is that you've got on?
that's got nothing to do with it!
well, good for you.
we are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
did anyone else know about the baby?
little smoke: like a polish four- alarm fire, is all.
to the cucamonga shopping center.
quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
where you boys going?
for when the time comes..
charlie!
so i guess that's it.
boyfriend? what about all that talk about riding my waxer?
engaged.
have you heard from judith's parents?
what do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
maybe you ought to see a doctor.
i 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
every day.
greetings king arthur.
oh, forget it. clark brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. take me?
i'll tell you who you are.  you're the glue.  you're the thing that holds everybody around you together. you're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  it's a gift.
i'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
i've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
sure you don't want your wallet?
never been better. peter spent the night. i must really love him. he's still alive.
what do you mean, frame-up?
you're not going anywhere!
what's with the wigs?
yes, patrick?
you live in...alaska.  the only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
you're wastin' your time, roy.
done.  we go now.
turned czech huh?
me first.
i'm very sorry i...
bill, i...
you sure about this faa announcement?
downtown?  fine.  get a hold of santino, i'd be more than glad to talk to him.
i have to.
it's no meteor, that's for sure!
hello.
malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. i'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
what is this? does everybody know everything i'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
do you own a video camera?
another one?  what word did he leave?
i hope so.
there is no such thing.
i thought you didn't.
go on - go on - see if i care. but it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow.
you never told me how your parents met.
hope i didn't hurt him too bad.
sorry ...
the 6 horse is last.
i'm not sure i do, archie.
no?
i'll go up and take a look at the general —- perhaps sit with him.
what happens when the baby comes?
the cemetery is nearer the castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the castle originally?  -- i always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  isn't there?
what's up with this shit.
yeah.
stephanie loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. we had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...and we did...we would play games - she would be the executioner and i would be the convict - she would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
where do you live?
in a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... why does he set this line apart?
don't know if i can hold it that long, sam.
whoa. some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. i'm a brewski man myself.
you said it in that tone! like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
is jean michel here?
what? quit hollerin'.
how the hell did you do that?
why?
what? yes, that's fine.
yes.  you may.  but maybe... i don't know...
hi.
mademoiselle.
i'd want to pay you... and i was thinking --
i don't know.  i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  i don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  i don't even know when it's going to happen.
here's your class.
what the hell happened here?
ted, the lever!
please don't do it again.
we got reinforced. most of'em just got outa boot...
why not?
a week. two weeks. no more.
i'm getting a chest cold..
nothing comes.
we'll get caught.
i would.
yeah only i wish they had the sister on more.
nevermind.  any five.  so four more.
are you sleeping?
shit.  i was afraid of that.  she left this garbled message on my machine.  can you calm her down?
what time?
no. i'm airsick you asshole! where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
i'm figurin' how i can say it so's you won't get mad.
you haven't done that in a long time...
here's my theory. twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. finds out his son-in-law is involved.
the graf spee...
vanish into thin air?
am i wrecking my car?
sarah sorkin. ramona barcelona -- this is miles massey.
he's so...it's too much...and i can't...i can't breath...
ask this one favor --
no, no, i'm all right, son... this damn leg just won't act right no more!
right.
thanks for playing along. i just have to sit for a while.
why else?
i don't see why.  i don't believe we've ever met.
thought you were going to buy a car.
how was your day?
no, marietta, i haven't found 'em.
you see, that's just the thing. paul and i have special permission to fly low.
pleased to meet you.  i'm loretta king.
maybe not? i'm feeling lucky ..
it's not hopeless...
no, i come to see doctor.
we need each other now, i need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
they could be.
did karl go to bed?
who was fixing to betray us!
yah, no problem, i'll just fax that over to ya, then.
and with prison record.
i need you to stake me. i can't do it without it. it's just a couple hundred grand. taken out of our cut when we're done.
not terrific enough. what were you doing in that part of town? who were you with?
a few more moments, still in this business.  then i'd find you.
no, i'm not mr. dickson!
my god.  you even cooked up that norfolk trip.
she didn't say anything about it to me.
is this your house?
right now -- i am.
hey, jimmy, where they taking us?
like putting on a play... guess some people forgot their lines.
every seat for the opening has been sold at vienna. sold out for three days.
what do you do on the towers?
what about the heart that you promised tin man --?
what did you find out?
now we had a deal here! a deal's a deal!
who was the last person you had sex with?
beatnik! go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
nothing's going to happen to you while i'm around -- i want you to believe that.
how many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
the church is a fucking racket. i know how they operate. i've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. my aunt lu says i was crying all the way through. yeah, i know their game inside out. now i'm free of it and i'm gonna stay that way.
holy shit.  who do they represent, god?
you live a fabulous life, robin.
cute?
there's a lot of funny things down this way, louis.
as a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer george viznick, we welcome peter kelson, author of the current best-seller, vicious intent. thank you for joining us, peter.
hello?
all right! where's my father
how'd you know where to find me?
aren't these lovebirds?
didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
what's that?
is there a mrs. canfield?
you're sure?  there was nothing?
and how long have you been a dentist?
what the heck do you mean?
turn yourself in.
it's alright, peter, we're fine.
closest and oldest.
ted!
there's a lot of competition for amusement out there. you gotta adapt to survive.
did it ever occur to you that i might have some feelings about you moving to new york?
yo, that's my girl.
never?
oh, you dawg you.  better not be my nurse!
nick, you're wasting your time... listen to me! you're wasting your time! this is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! this is it. here we are... and we gotta get out!
oh, hi.  i'm glad you made it.  did you bring anybody?
charlie, i'm from the old country, and these american ways get me sometimes confused. you tellin' us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses?
so, how is it that you guys are fluent in russian?
then where do we go?!
where are you, what floor?
well, i didn't want to say anything, but i thought the dead man was my brother.
got it?  good.  do not discuss anything over the telephone.  do not talk to the neighbors.  stay out of your yard.
god, i wish i could prove you killed everybody.  unfortunately, i know who the real killer is.
morning, hollis.
you're a fucking dead man--
because i love it so. it's beautiful there. especially at sunset.  ah... thank you for the fire.
don't write that part.
yes. house. more amendments--more changes--and the bill goes back to the senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. the senate doesn't like what the house did to the bill. they make more changes. the house doesn't like *those* changes. stymie. so they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. finally, if the bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. and--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  are you catching on, senator?
enough. cut him loose.
it won't work.
oh, mrs. crawford don't believe in them!
mrs... sutphin?
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
john, there's someone here who would like to meet you. would that be alright?
should i?
no.  yes, of course i'm mad, because you love me, i know that.
donovan asked to see you before you leave.
-- do you know what these are, elaine?
you saved my life.
who the devil is he?
i've also been thinking about the team. responsibilities, who should cover what --
it may sound like music to her -- i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower.  click — click — click.
five steeds and a few hackneys...
go sit over in that chair.
you have to find them, utapan.  look what they did!
nick, i gotta tell you, i got pinched twice for no reason. you really gotta be careful. i'm running a licensed place. everything's legit.
my daughter, rachel.
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel.
so they tell the kid to throw the world series, or else, huh?
mom, dad. meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. he's what you'd call clinically bummed.
wow. you look beautiful.
who told!
-- i wouldn't bring up paris if i were you. it's poor salesmanship.
nobody's going to hang.  we're all gonna walk away with a little something.  i ain't a greedy man. and, hell, you did all the work. one-hundred-thousand dollars.  split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  give or take.
man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
you're hot!
y'all take american express?
c'mon, norman!
like i always do?
you've got a private office here, haven't you?
i've been all right.
you know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. how do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
that's terrible.
at the finish, it's single action by two, fasanella second, visitation third.  line on single action... 3 to 2. hell with it, that's no good.
mary clarence?  like a guy?  like a dumb guy?
can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
are you finished?
it's mine.  talley.
we'll take it!
mr. liebkind, mr. liebkind.
c'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. your father'll never miss it.
oh, you don't appreciate it. her pictures don't do her justice. why, gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and i know queens!  and oh, has she got herself a nose - and i know noses too. that little snozzle of hers is the berries, i tell you. and is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
it still doesn't matter if i kiss you?
where'd you find such creeps?
until you, or anyone else ...
hi.
goddamn it, sean, you listen to me or i will kick your ass, do you hear me?
what are you doing here?
what happened?  where's sandy?
that little old man.
stanley.  stanley... you knew the... stanley.  you knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
wow. i thought i was the only one.
what?
without a love of my own.
i didn't.  until i was dispatched to clean up one of the flight 180 survivors.
can i take your coat?
thank you.  if i had that kind of support on a daily basis, i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
it's not a bad place.  warm. great view.
so what...? the best is yet to come. check the tv guide. they got our dr. towler on a panel on gbh on friday: 'the healing hand. the experts speak.'
oh god. don!!! why can't i just die.
but, pg&e told her about the chromium?
a show?!  like this sunday?
oh... i guess i'll die now.
what's your name, boy?
come on, phil.  you're not gonna let this slide.  what about her parents?  what about what else she's published?  at least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  major!
if she?
logan, i want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
it would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
yeah. my own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— i had it in me to hit the top and—  boy, if i wanted to, the things i could tell you about them guys— 
let me get your change.
holden got hit.
do you know what's wrong with you?
we're closed.  come back in the morning.
that's where he fell.
elden, let me out of here. now! this is ridiculous, i need medical attention!
goin' out with these clowns for a while.
i don't want to go home.
what fence? who?
yeah, great.
why don't you come home with me?  i mean nobody's home at my house--and i'm not tired, are you?  i don't have many--people i can talk to.
you're getting' 10 cc's
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
how long she been dead?
where is everybody?
if you don't mind, mam, i'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
sal?
my lawyer, tom hagen.  he arranged this all through your man turnbull.
are these the articles?
i've been a good worker --
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. that's partly why i was in custody so long. sixty days.
you don't know?
where is he?
you're convinced that it's genuine.
that's a good thing?
where's your friend? he go with the chiquita?
what is it?
i feel very emotional right now.  a bit out of control.
it's early.
about forty-five dollars.
but he was eating lunch a mile away when the turk smashed into killed himself.
best in the fleet !
kevin, come on, the bus to stifler's is gonna be here soon.
there isn't!  there's nothing under here but more floor.  jesus fucking christ!  we killed a man for nothing but floor.
i may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
um...chris --
the most important one. can you help me find him?
where's your manners? make room for homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
ah, nothing.
well, what did i tell ya?
the matrix?  yeah.
he was gentlemanly. i like that.
home. your home. the address on your form.
he's in it with willis?
i thought you were a december baby.
and ask me what?
we don't go around altering valuable paintings, dr. venkman.
ready for what?  sight-seeing?
ask the chinese mission to leave our country. immediately.
we're just -- observing.
it wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. i don't want to talk about it. stupid mustache cup.
i don't even think you have a gun!
you okay?
a--flack jacket.
this game is pretty important to him. he made all-stars in high school, you know.
i can't even keep fish alive.
well if they can kill the president, they can certainly get me.
do you know where fuse box is?
you're late.
this is me in cincinnati.
damned if i know.
fall in love.
they ran shit back in the eighties. used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. that's back when the irish was making a play against the italians. i don't know if they still around, but i don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
now, that's a nice thing to say.
working late.  you're a damn fool.
and i you.
he has his uses too.
shoot.
let's go with it.
you must be planning on doing some hunting.
why didn't you tell me?
you're right.
we're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, i mean ms. heller. maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
yes.
we'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  car went up in the gunfight.
and of course the beck's, with the...
after my wife died, i felt like a fifth wheel. you know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...when ethel passed away, i was lost. i couldn't function socially and i couldn't function in business.
you can't trust anything these days.
and he drove me to mine.
ready.
i trust you, bill.
otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, i'll dip my beak just a little.  just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
little nicky.
yup.
you're talking about the precogs...
spock...  what have you done to my friends?
seventy --  dorothy, please!
just a boid in a gilded cage -
so i hear you're taking some time.
i said when can leo be taken to ceremony?
thanks for handling this.
yeah. yeah. yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
chicago.
motherfuckers...
melissa!
i can't talk right now.
yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. and i didn't get you out so you could go on a goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
i was undercover as a tennis player.
mr. gittes, my field men are out and i can't give you an exact location...
i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
how much of that letter was on the up and up?
no.
if you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
oh, everything is so wonderful! it's getting farther and farther away!
she was there...
hell of a way to get out. heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
to my triumph, of course.
hello, wyatt!  hiya doc!
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling, they try to shoot it off.
none at all?
joe knew the whole story.  i told him.  it was his idea that i come clean.  i mean i wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what i mean?
i don't know much about him. how do you know if a guy is decent?
it was fun, anyhow.
so maybe we got enough for one ticket. fuck!
anyone else want one? rolfe?
mr. levene...?
he's comin' back?. what for?
and one bullet.  that's all it's gonna take.
go where?
you don't have any baggy shorts? pajama bottoms?
and now that superman's out of the nice guy business...
it’s heading for the oil terminal.
she knew you'd find out who lisa henderson is.  you're a good cop -- what did she do?  tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  did she tell you in bed, nick? that's how i'd do it.
hey, ros.  nice view, huh?
hi, joe.
you strapped?
for a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
it's not "invisibility" per se. you're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. that's what you projected on the bridge.
i know i did. but i don't.
you don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
you're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
you know what i mean.
good luck to you, rose.
i told you, i don't know where sidney is. and even if there was a third killer, sidney doesn't know about it.
i said: cut it out!
the word is mob.
and who are you, alexander?  who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  this is the world now.  i am fact.
can i see him?
what?  hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
like something different. i don't know.  you're leavin' ain't you, karl?
no sir.
he looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
sorry.
how long we going to keep this up.
what's the attraction? i don't see it?
beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  we can do some great logging up here.
not now. you got my bag?
uh... huh huh. i have a couple. butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
jude, you okay?
what do you want to do with it?
the empire considers this a matter of internal security. we regret you've become involved.
and what do you call this?
all right!  what do you want?
do i want you?
dad, i'm so sorry.  i know this is a bad time.
the way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  what strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
we never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. we always performed as a private ensemble. as i think i already told you, i was a freelance conductor.
i'll ask you again, dr. venkman.  why were you digging the hole?  and please remember that you're under oath.
but what about beast?   who'll...?
no it's not. do you know how you did it will?
mitch? why are they doing this?  the birds.
i'm very sorry to...
you stole her purse!  while you were saving her?
what sort have you got?
we closed.
makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
okay, harry, i'm wrong. you're not the one he's setting up.
speak for yourself. i get chicks looking at me all the time. all ages.
hi, i'm kit. i'm not keeping you from anything important, am i?
yes.
the men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
can we talk later? will you be at the party?
what?...
he escaped...
good day, sir.  i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well?
please don't.
what?
you'll stalk the streets of london a creature of the night.
shhhh... it's all right... also, i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
i've got a great view up here. i can see all the --
no, that's true.
as different as it's possible to be.
i'm still trying to ditch this texas smokey. i don't know what the sucker wants.
no, no --  now don't tell me.  they -- they don't understand you at home.  they don't appreciate you. you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
ask him.
what did i tell you?
..or hard wired..
if anything happened to you i'd never forgive myself.
don't promise...just deliver.
just souvenirs.  towels and stuff.
are you shy, mr. booker?
what is it?
hey there. i thought i heard somebody on the porch. wasn't your name karl?
don't see why i can't ride, too! i'm second in command, damn it!
that's its name. a pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
mrs. robinson, it makes me sick that i said that to you.
what friend is that?
malcolm's okay for now.  i gave him a shot of morphine.
how awesome?
you're just a nice guy, mr. mulvaney. only don't fuck around with me, you know what i mean?
ray barboni. guy from miami, owns leo now that momo died.
wait! i'll go with you!
i thought you'd be up with the sun.
would you shut up?
it was gracious of you to share it with me. good day, mademoiselle, monsieur.
money?  if that's what it signifies to you. security?  comfort?  all it is is things that happen to you.  that's all it is.  how are they different?  some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  some busboy wins the lottery.  all it is, it's a carnival.  what's special...what draws us?  we're all different.  we're not the same.  we are not the same.  hmmm.  it's been a long day.  what are you drinking?
jesus, ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
it's not a good case.  it's a very good case.  a healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
what?
no.
i'm fine. i'm fine, i just wanna keep playing --
she said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  she wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
mom.
of course it counts. how do you play?
i figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
that's besides the point.
men?
uh-huh. fell right on my head.  sprechen sie deutsch?
a girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
red ball?
uh - will that hold you, joe?
he says wednesday at three o'clock at the beverly wilshire. he wants everybody there.  he'll talk to you. if after talkin' to you he's convinced you're ok, he'll do business. if not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. he also wants a sample bag.
rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay god.
fine.  or it was until a couple of days ago. a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story. they want to publish it on christmas day.
i do.
you'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
oh, it's very difficult. you know harry...we didn't do...
in a sense, that's all he knew. the system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
jeezus!
get that for me, will ya baby?
eh, hi, andy.  look, this tony clifton... is he performing anywhere?
careful,  captain, they've been known to charge.
god, i miss you. i don't know what to do without you.
hello. i'm doctor livingston. i've been asked to talk to you. may i?
two.
look, ted, i don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
why not take the doctor's advice? you're the hero of the battle of corphon.
didn't think i could.
sal?  what's that for?  salvatore?
you were making a generalization about "broads!"
keeping of the souls. do they still burn their dead or something?
get out of here.
y'know, uncle frank...
you do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
who asked you?
scarecrow?
where'd the road go?
for what purpose?
don't leave me.
i know just how you feel, son. but believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
no one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
"paid vindication"  that's what i call justice.
jesus christ! who's been talking to you?  what's going on? how can you just turn away?  what about the others?
but with the six months off i get for being your guinea pig, i've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
it's changing characteristics.  it's solidifying taking on weight.
ahh. 'national geographic." in my day, this made 'playboy" look like mother goose.
but it's...
this honey doesn't handle so good in town...
ever watched a man die?  if you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. and if you're very quick, you can catch it.
it's against my better judgment...
you've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  with everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. you could get a cramp.
need any help?
i'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
i called, you know.
i've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
may i use your telephone?
i was looking at you, your clothes, i wouldn't have known you...
raziel!  i transformed them all! i'm a magician!
cut it out, pa. he'p al with the truck.  don't fret, honey. you goin' to be awright.
in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  that's her place.
what did he play?
did you pay the guy the reward?
faster!
not tom. whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, i told you, in her clothing. semen. the laboratory got a blood group reading from that. the man was blood type 0; tom was an ab.
she needs help.
with a little jazz.
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. i have them soaking.you can wear these.
no!  i warned the english to go back home -- i begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat i would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
but . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
jake...
i'll fix ya some eggs.
he owned the colored roadhouse before big o--
they're english soldiers, ain't they?
what i love.
the screen is enormous! imagine king kong up *there*! have you seen a lot of movies here?
kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
may be a few minutes. i gotta stick around here...
listen up. i need directions. downtown. somebody named hershe.
when was the last time i said a word?
you a reporter?
mr ripley? i'm alvin maccarron.
good morning, wanda.  hi, hartley.
can i keep it?
wait, betty... you still haven't answered me.
m'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
mind your tongue, madame.
the only realty i see is that i'm a prisoner on my own ship. what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
no. no, they're white. he's got a nice dog.
so you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
what? what is it?
ilene, rick promised...
don't cane me, sir, i was led astray.
nothing.
i want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
i watched your simulation, mr. barnes. very impressive. you know, you're the only one to ever go up against sid 6.7 who is still alive.
her new boyfriend.
spunk, come back...
i must go.
but...
feral? don't touch him! he might be diseased! he might... my god, rabies!
mug sheets.
you see, i-i've been thinking about it and i think that we should get married.
well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
where you shot her.
they do what i tell 'em.
why?
he went off someplace.
yes, sir.
well, it's all just part of this - they don't know i need it, see. okay, so there's that. and even if they did, i wouldn't get it.  so there's that on top, then. see, these're personal matters.
i'm sorry about what i said, really i am. just take me with you, i don't care where.
you see, i have this theory about men with glasses.
she's cracking, norman.
tom...
what was i gonna say?
oh, no you don't!
i'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
yeah... mmmm, that sounds good... uhu...
there is nothing.
jets.
goodbye, darling.
good night.
no.  i'm afraid to ask what this is about.
john, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
you told me.
who's that?
i like you, baron.
and there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
it's done?
what's happening?
it could all be coincidental.
we get the mask i'll tell you.
uhhh...anything i can do for you? she laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
yoyodyne propulsion systems?  you think they're mixed up in this?
great!  that's fucking great!  they only asked you to sing because of your name!  you can stick it above the browser racks over there.
we can't just assume they're standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch. i'd have to write in an aglet.
murder, honey.
always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  i think, suzette, i have never been so tired in my life.  veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
what was it?
what're you laughing about?
jimmy didn't kill leo. why do you wanna do this?
splendid.
you shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. i'll take it.
they're still on the property. maybe you better stay inside.
we don't both have to die.
yeah, fish live in the present.  they don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  no guilt afterward. no whining on some fish-shrink's couch. they just do it.  they accept.
that's it! we made it!
i don't wanna go, i can't do it this time.
so, we must face china and all her might alone.
guess!
i can't. it's too big.
um--hello? i've got like a social emergency here.
i'm a push-over for whom?  what is it? who's on the phone?
i guess i've come to quite a place.
you know chastity?
yeah, i know all that.
forgive me for askin', son, and i don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
is this whitemail?
did you recognize the voice of the caller?
but irena is in the garden. she's right there, under the tree.
about time!
los angeles, california.
your horses are hungry, that's what she did say, come sit down beside me, an' feed them some hay. my horses ain't hungry, they wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
a dull cliche.
no.
mph rmph rm!
i can't. i'm seeing a friend.
not yet.  we did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
elliot.
okay.  so is that a yes or a no?
i command you, as king of the britons to stand aside.
something like that. you are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. he does, somewhat reluctantly. she gives him a shot in the bum.
mr. harris?
when my money moves, i go with it.
yes.
adam....you should go with dr. aron. it's the best thing.  the best thing for you. i promise.
no, it's not that simple, dave...
look. you were really high. things happen.
colonel munro, i have known you as a gallant antagonist. i am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
they're coming back!
...and bill mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
you just came down here for the weather, right, mr. nixon?
i didn't want to be going around your back.
gosh, you look nice.
pull out, goddamnit!
pay is so damn low. i don't want my kids to grow up like barney's.
what happened to speak when spoken to?
yeah, right.
that's terrible!
she's fucking hot!
satisfied?
you know.
all they want to see is your work. what's wrong with that?
you mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
marge, i don't know you, so i have no right, but dickie loves you. he's -- i think you'll find he's coming home to you.
sign here please.
yes.  would you care for another one?
i think they overdid it a bit. too much alcohol. overwhelms the fruit.
tommy, jake respects you. he won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. but you know when jake gets set on somethin', jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. i'm his kid brother. i got no say with jake on this. he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
huh?
thrr...
yes ... you know it!  yes ... i will. yeah!
i am a starfleet officer.
we get ivan into the comets path--
well, she loves children, all right.  she loves everybody.
it has to be frida. this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
i'm not. but there's --
no, they--
where we meeting 'em...?
that makes two of us.  lieutenant saavik was right: you never have faced death --
what?
but not impossible... gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
she's a he. his name is swifty.
didn't seem worried about them.
time for a change.  keep your margins straight.
i suppose you're right.
before london.  but after you took the bible out of the drake hotel in chicago.
are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
he could get into people's heads. make them see things. terrible things.  and he could levitate. juggle fire.
if it's in italian, how will i know what they're saying?
just taste that christmas turkey.
no... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. that's not too suspicious, is it?... but it wasn't like i was feeling bad about the divorce. just the opposite.
all right, but...
i'm special.
still worried?
turns out i'm allergic to steel-toed boots. go figure.  by the way, i'm not looking for a matching set.  where's quincey?
i think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
and this butterfield guy--
tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
well, i'll be--!!!
don't ask me questions.  i got connections.  you find out who i am, you're cold meat.
kip?
hello, brad.
the old man? he's gonna tell you who killed leo?
but i'll tell you something, what i said in their, still goes. you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
six twenty-seven in the morning... but the money?
i've been a soldier too.  there is a difference.  a policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
and do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
a vampire with a human soul. an immortal with a mortal's passion. you are beautiful, my friend. lestat must have wept when he made you --
micheal, by accident.
the idiot?
it is?
what happened to your hair?
cast stood me up.
of course.
fuck off! he never wrote any of them.
you're trusting.
just - say it. say it just once.
there's a dip at this end. and since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
is he coming home?
how'd you get started?
i just can't trust you anymore.
a cold drink.
what do you mean 'we...?'
no.
she's been stalking you, peter.
i don't know!
i have a job.
the cash man!
they're all divorced?
yea, how much?
that's me and my daughter adele. my pride and joy.  charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
how many colonists?
uh-huh. well, this ain't the railroad. now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
he had no choice.  you're a formidable adversary.
and if we're unlucky?
religion?
not if i stay away from him.
just what makes you and them krauts so buddy-buddy?
you already know what they are.
uh-huh.
sleep well?
i can wait. where would you like to go? we'll make this a special night...
this is a sign! someone's coming to take buzz away from me. i don't know if you're the guy or what, but i'm not letting it happen. i'm leaving him first.
what do i play?
that's easy. me.
okay.   how much?
before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
start it.
you look terrible. have you had an accident?
the captain and chief engineer... they've been...they're dead.
cuervo jones' right-hand man. one tough hombre. you don't understand, snake. cuervo jones wants to unify the island. we're on the move, man. big time.
you feel violated?
yeah, you know. you know what it felt like.
hobart, what are you people doing here?
no.
what's goin' down, son?
nix, the law!
so spill it.  spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
now let's see you act your way out of this one.
... and if you'd come in the middle, i'd have stopped, i couldn't have gone on-
it was probably meant to be like this. each of us has a star to follow. so now what are you thinking of doing?
you call about monsieur kane?  john michael kane?
not unless you hear my confession.
walter?
it is. you got yourself on tv again.
how ya doin'?
great.
want me to take a look?
uh.  have you told luke and the ki...
don't worry about anything, frankie five-angels.
'ere.  he says he's not dead.
that's right, now if you could...
you've said a lot of things about the president in the last few months.
i think we made a mistake here.
yeah.  those.  that always put the fear of god in me.  what about you?
because i don't know.
drink this! it will dull your pain.
you're going to miss the top ten.
i don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
[reina rosas.]
i had to acknowledge a delivery.  mother, i'd like you to meet...
what in...?
he said he was her cousin.  i told him where she works.  they were just here.
tea... or whiskey?
i need my shoes in total focus right here and also joe back there--!
we don't kill. killing is what damns you. it-. what am i talking about? this conversation is over. you're going away to school.
yeah, when's he coming?
i don't know.
but i've seen a ship with black sails.
wait a minute, walter. you can't do that!
what's happened to you?
yes.
it's written all over you like a neon sign. now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better.
i didn't mean the things that i said... i was angry and i said more than i meant to.
yeah. funny--
he wants to step into my shoes!  he wants to step into my shoes!
it's not going to work.
and how many room got tv, dusty?
yeah, sykes?
it's cool, but where's the water?
how much is a shave and a haircut, roger?
are your parents alive?
the owl is a messenger. when one shows itself to a sioux... it means someone's gonna die. the owl told him about leo.
three down, four to go --
to rutagunda's place. it is close by.
are my seams straight?
that i'm a sick and disgusting person.
you were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
it's a post all vienna seeks. if you want it for your husband, come tonight.
well, marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
what happened was, i'm on vacation, alone... i was robbed, at gunpoint. they hit me and ran.  two men, a few blocks away.  they took my wallet, money... all of it.  so...
what's it for?
not me. no way.
use the little brush there.  why were you at santos'?
what's going on?
he'll know we're in trouble.  he heard me, i said "there are three..."
what did he say?
valerie doran? two floors up, one window over.
little ratty-ass.
well -- until the policeman whistles again.
my little volga boatman! stop threatening! i don't deserve this.  are you my little volga boatman?
howdy, hank.
uh, sure. uncle billy.
okay, honey - but just the same i'd like to take a crack at that—
yeah.
no, honey, not to be a hero. but i want you to remember something for me, all right?
excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. dinner will be ready shortly.
in a fire? never.  look, i'm his brother. i care about him, y'know? he was going to get himself killed. maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. and i couldn't -- i just couldn't...
there's no connection between the families.
your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
aren't you the bitter one.
i --
i did?
uh... yeah. yeah. she's real nice.
dead?
we are looking for you.
it was fine.
claire, when did you...
these questions have nothing to do with your trial.
the cape. the turban. she wouldn't understand.
aww, man. you just need to chill out. come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. lot's of alcohol and honeys.
orvolle. his wine.  from now on, nothing but water at every meal --
they came in and they, you know...
jody, she's alive.
there was no sperm.
that is one ugly sunrise.
how's that?
i understand...
okay, we'll come back to that.  so, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  it's longdale, looking for a snuff film. and you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
'63 chevy.
officers, officers what can i do for you today? i ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
get me the radio tower!
what makes you think that?
don babytalk him man. cocksucker fell asleep. they walked right up on us, he don do shit.
i won't thank you! i'll never thank you!
if you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  you'll report me for drug evasion.
what are you talking about?
there must be a phone around here somewhere.
we're not going to get a ride tonight.
i love linda, see. i love linda more than i can even say.
...quarrel?
sure - i think so, stew.
we did it one time, only once.  it had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  everything i've got i've earned.
you bet. how much is that worth?
mister chekov, log mister spock's starfleet commission reactivated; list him as science officer; both effective immediately.
why?
now gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
hot tip,  rubber biscuit in the third race at arlington.
where'd you get this?
i'm afraid that's a little out of my...
it's just possible she didn't...
damn you, de sade!  you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
right. but when you deflower a girl, that's it. you did it. you were the one. no one else can ever do it.
and what are you thinking we should do now?
would you like me to change anything?
you have no right to do this.
he was losing weight. he looked kind of tired sometimes. but he was working so hard... still, i felt something was wrong.  and i can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
what'd you do that for? it's an in- teresting story. all these people are still disappearing. right off the street.  hey, what's wrong? are you all right?
what about us? don't forget to mention us.
hey.
thank you for your gift. i'm sorry about marie.
you know i'm writing a play -- it's just a little broadway thing, but there's a part in it that i think you'd be perfect for.
what did you find out, mike?
uh ... you don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, lloyd?
he's the headmaster of daisy's school.
fine.  what's all this stuff?
search me! when i come to i was running down thirty-fifth street.
i want to look around, daddy-- may i?
if he arrives before us, it will be too late.
how old you?
i wonder if i hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
i was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
oh it did?
did you actually give williams that gun?
a non-terrestrial intelligence.
so, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
we mate for life.  divorce... is a strange concept to us.
one of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  not too fat- not too thin.
there's nothing in there worth stealing!
you must excuse the doctor.  no one has ever beaten him at his little game.
there's a lot you don't know about me.
we can get a warrant if you like.
oh, okay. like this.
dead, huh?
okay, tell you what... you can still be the school r.a., but no dance tomorrow night.
have we met before?
go, chief.
you're not hurt, are you?
i'm going to pull some strings. it's our only hope.
oh sure.
why, you've always been pixilated, longfellow.
that's six hundred pounds, harry. two hundred to follow you, and i've raised it four hundred.
well -- i could try. do you wash your hair every day?
dad, are we hit?!
wil, i'm giving you your freedom. do you understand?
really?
get well soon.
oh, the girl at the piano?
this is a.t.f. agent ray nicolet, jackie brown, ordell robbie money exchange trial run. it's three p.m., july 4th 1997. the location is the parking structure at lax.
swimming with his hat on?  that's original.
she was --
young adult.
that kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
what the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. hemingway, van gogh... um... herve villachaise...
hey--they actually found the place!
scientists.  i'm supposed to report in to them.  they'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
have you ever been there before?
yes.
less than a mile.  forty-one wagons, a company of redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
hiroshima.
well, they wouldn't own it, i'd own it. i'd pay them back in product.  they can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
i don't know, where are yours?
i don' need a hospital... i feel fine.
i ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a c.d. from me. ford.  you suck.
yeah, i did.
honey --
her father loading up the shotgun?
what the hell was that about --
don't run off, jude.
you don't have to show me anything, mr. rogers.  i believe you.
you the only sentry?
how did you survive?
alright.  this is really great.  alright, we're going out. it's a date.  it's a scam.  whatever, whatever, alright, i'll pick you up at what, eight o' clock?
how did i beat you?
it's in a case, on his desk.
an... entertainer?
david.  there's a call for you.  it's your wife.
excuse me?
excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
why?
what was that?
no, i'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when i ran out of the hospital, i, i was so thrilled because they told me i was going to be all right.  and i'm running down the street, and suddenly i stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, i'm not going to go today. i'm okay.  i'm not going to go tomorrow.  but eventually, i'm going to be in that position.
let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
it's not enough.  more!  more, do you hear me?
i still can't believe it paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
well, many reasons, actually...
numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
how come ya wanna hang out with those guys? they teach ya bad things.
the crowds at andrew's airkorce base, the "old shoe" banners, the "courage, mom," banners.  the still band.  a shot of the bandmaster, surreptitiously, glancing at his watch.
hungry.
we're very unhappy.
i don't know.
and if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
let's get out of here! i'll lose my job!
do you understand that?
it's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
i just did. because i have the power.
i told you not to make that deal, saddam!
it's a helluva disease.
dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. we are so very very back.  i re-signed cush. we're set.
what!
not with me, you're no champion. you're stepping way up in class.
no!
you bet your ass he will.
i know you're not.
what can i do for you guys?
you don't have to lose your temper!  that's what you told me the last time too. every time i step in to protect you. at the elk's dance[7] when that big swede made a pass at you—
nah.
gee, this looks like a fun place.
what made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  she'd never won a bloody thing.
oh, how do you do?
yeah. he went to harward.
thirty-seven. i just can't...
do you know what bembry is doing? you're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
sang.
good year? well, between you and me, mr. carter, we're broke.
thank god.
i'm afraid not.
it must be this one.
you're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. i read that. the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. that's your enemy, not your audience. your audience hasn't even been born yet. it's a lie that art is popular. the only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. i'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. there're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and andy's one of them.
true suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
eighteenth century.
jesus, karen, you're breaking my heart here --
you on any medication?
stand up.
miles. three other suits. that's all i know 'em as -- suits. were you there?
hello, ralph.
somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
hello.
i'm all right, mom. i'm not in siberia, you know.
go to hell!
let me ask you a hypothetical question: if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence?
there was just...some tension.  you were upset.  i remember being concerned.
that's him alright.
we have received new orders. upon our arrival at regula i, all materials of project genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at ceti alpha vi.
yes, it's so nice i thought i'd work outside.
so saw my hands off, i left you a present.
about cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
it's just insurance.
i am sorry for you mr. james.  i'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  what are the odds, gentlemen, that i don't live to see mr. james hang yet?
absolutely.
he's a ghost!
that's the way i thought of them sometimes.
respect, i always dished ya respect.
cancoon.
jesus, steven, that's...that's really lovely.
...why did he come back?  why did the boy turn back...?
rescue one -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
doing what?
i'm sorry.
what did he say exactly? i mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
hello, william. i understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. i would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
i get my revenge and make some fast cash.
but i've got school.
bill sampson? he's - he's a director.
hold it, sefton. so we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
then why are you looking for her?
and my class. it'll be hard to find a good substitute. and what about my math program?
that's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. that pudding's not mine.
who does not?
i understand.  pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
oh just about everything, i guess. those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. they keep taking things out. she's going to come home an egg shell. tough, though.. she's tough.
he would have loved this.
yeah, my grammy.
it does matter. we're in love.
i don't know.  fly casual.
general, hang on... drink slowly. you are blessed by the gods to have a physician and a divine of janus with you tonight.  a fan sent them to you.
it's registered in my mother's name.
listen sarah, i think i know what's going on ok.  i went to the waxwork today.i met this man.
oh, ha, ha, ha.
he's dead. he can't talk.
do you think the assistant, what's his name...
how long have they been gathering there?
i could have made it, you know.  i didn't need your help.
oh?
why do you do these stupid things?!
heard grandpa santos and grandmama talkin'.
dick, can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes?  we're on our way through to the basement - i promise we won't keep her very long.
keyser soze
remember the first time we made love - and then ---
father, i don't understand. tell me what happened?
someone who loves you.
you must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular ivy leaguer. turns out he is king farouk. mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. a girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? who needs it! you listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some good time charlie?  sssh!
got it?
that kind of behavior will get you a p.a. rating, my friend.
well... thanks, anyway.
i brung you a little basket of goodies. fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
you don't think i'll do it, do you?
if you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
they know what--this fella looks like?
let's meet tonight, okay?
excuse me, timmy. could you help us? we're trying to settle a bet.
no, there's only one report to complete.  i'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the castle today or tomorrow.
i know. it's awful, isn't it? night of the living cheerleaders.
it's... behind... us.
i'm going to have a baby.   michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  diedre mayfair curry. pretty, huh...?  funny --- i never really thought i'd ever ---
he never said "go".
you can't be more specific than that?
oh my, isn't that pretty! what is it?
i'm getting pneumonia. i have a fever. feel my forehead...
i don't understand.
yeah.  it was terrible.
she's dead?
it's a trap. there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. nobody ever does. it's just the bait. this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
what was that about the ss, the rate, the ... ?
let me get the light.
know what you mean, blair.  trust is a tough thing to come by these days. just trust in the lord.
i'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
listen, did i tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and clement?  let me tell you.  it's one of the funniest stories --
you know, i think it's been five years since i saw you eat anything. that's the god's truth.
you know this guy, don't you?
yeah.
kelly scott.
that was my last.
why?
fabrizio said you might be up --
what the fuck is he doing?
some crazy jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
and, father, i've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have i?
i'm afraid lhe's not a doctor.
i mean, the whole sanitation thing. joseph lister... 1895. before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
you caught me on my way to the shower.
i couldn't face her if i had slept with somebody else.
maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
now put them together. bugger off, you bloody sod.
how's work?
hmmmm . . .
no.
no, really, i liked it...thought it was great.
hey! what's the idea...?
let's get outta here... i suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. feelin' all that voodoo...
get some sugar too, for the coffee.
tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus. probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. fucking raid.
so who you taking to the prom?
no, thank the lord.  he's more like his mother.
we find the man and then we dissect him-
to the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  that my drugs had gone through.  what would have been the harm?  a few people get high who are getting high anyway. your partner is still alive.  we avoid having breakfast together. don't you see this means nothing? that your whole life is pointless?
well, i don't really listen to her when it comes to men. i mean, look at john, for crissake. oh, you went to school with him didn't you? you're probably friends or something.
and that's wholesale.  cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
lucky, hell.  i could do it every day.
he's right, jack. taylor is saying we may have some time. we've got to use it.
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
there's not a moment to lose! wake her up, but be gentle about it!  this woman is mankind's most precious possession! she is... perfect!
you're late.
i can't even take a shower here.
what are you doing this for, sanchez?
how about some evening clothes?
yeah...  come on, have a little training.
uh, well, i'm a little nervous, i never did a person before.
you could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
what are you talking about?
it was... fantastic.
i almost didn't make it to the bathroom, miguel. i almost lost control right in front of everybody.
be careful, julie.
you-betcha.
two: what if i didn't miss?
cyclops?
the hat business is in trouble.
every man betake him to his legs.
i told him i might.
you did? a human ear?
people change...you know.
we gotta get those locks changed.
the prime directive doesn't apply. these people are not indigenous to this world. they were never meant to be immortal. we'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
oh, thank you very much.
what did you say?
don't throw that away. i had that once with a guy. but i threw it away for a cheap thrill.
sir. sir.
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "jesse woodson james." jesse james? the jesse james?
bullshit!  if you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
yeah?
i knew it!
senator geary, i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  i have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars; why would i ever consider paying more?
then quit. you should be going to school anyway...
will you have a glass of sherry?
our vaccine may have no effect!
what were you like when you were younger?
the fuck you laughin' at?
it's humiliating.
can you open that panel?
not if i can help it. you got any information for me?
almost got me in billings. i saw you there, shooting at me.
suzie --
goes on like that quite awhile.  what do you gentlemen make of it?
just leave me alone and lets forget it.
a ride.  you want one?
closer?  i can try.
and, we're definitely filling a void in the rural south.
sure.  then we had a fight this morning.
what's this?
yeah, i know - picasso. <u>guernica</u>, right? that's what everybody says - although personally, i don't see the resemblance. what are you drinking?
dr. weir, i need you on the bridge.
but i like the presidential suite.
reiben, what's the matter with you? i don't gripe to you.  i'm a captain. there's a chain of command.  griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  you gripe to me, i gripe to my superior officers.  up, get it? i don't gripe to you, i don't gripe in front of you.  how long you been in the army?
and you didn't see anything at all?
yours, or the turkeys?
after all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
what would you guess, ardelia?
shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
so you’re not at a non- profit firm?
is she dying?
what did he say, exactly?
quietly effective.
i don't know. he has pains.
sure.
[uncertainly] in that thing...the jacket.
i told you what happened in rome!
turkish gecko, i believe.  a lizard.
you can't get sushi anywhere in japan after 2 o'clock. did you know that?
i mean sales has always been a feeder for m and a, always...
because you tell mom everything.
yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
i went to the woods because i wanted to live deliberately."  i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
does he have hair?
not now, toots--which is the right way to say this? you're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than i?
<i>                                   ... let's draw straws.</i>
come on, fellah -- speak up!
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
hi.
jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
dead, mrs. lampert -- like last week's news -- like charles, mrs. lampert --
i mean, it's your life.
run, snake...they're coming.
listen, you're dating luis, he's in arizona. you're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. what could you possibly be up to tonight?
bob, bob, stick to the business, will you?
i'll be seeing you.
let her go!
with your permission, mr. president, i'd like to remain my your side.
-- an investigator for the internal revenue service?
he's drugged out of his mind!  he's completely zoned out.
look, lady!  i told you!  it's not my problem!  i was just there!
what do you want?
'i've been so many places in my life and times. i've sung a lot of songs, i've made some bad rhymes...'
you should thank lou and i for the wedding car -- a '63 buick.
not in the nineties.
dirty cops. we'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
there are other doctors...yes, other doctors...better doctors...
it's already posted.
how'd ya do?
not over me. why would they have a falling out over me?
on our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. terminate us instantly. we'd never experience what it means to make love.
erin --
if i am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
how long will you set it for this time?
people throw stones.  they call me names.  i mean, really.
oh my g-d!  i'm not first!
that was fun last night.
what are you drinking?
i don't like getting grilled by that dea bitch, i don't like taking that kind of heat!
it isn't that -- you said, "have to go." what could compel you --
put it this way, he's mislaid him.
... what were you saying, admiral? something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
yes!  when i give the word -- throw the first switch!
oh, i wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
me and my brother chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. dad's knee was going. chris was engaged, you know that? two-face took...everything. now i can pay him back.
we just smeared a skunk.
colonel, i didn't request this transfer because you're my father. i requested it because i believe in this cause and this is where i can do the most good.
huh?
well, i -- i can't quite see.  why, she's crying.
here and there, scooter? here and there like boston, chicago, houston? the bay area? some action in london, 'til it turned nickel and dime. or how about that little stint down in miami? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there. you guy's pretty good?
we should abort.
ernie's.
is there anything you need? i'm going food-shopping.
the one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
what did he talk about when you guys went out? did he say anything?
just fine.
there are some who go to dr. jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
i said we're getting out of here. back to civilization. i made a deal with the porters. they brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. they're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. come on, get your things together. where's your top coat?
look here, i don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
willya lemme talk for chrissake? i'm trying to tell you what happened.  what happened is...
papa, is this your idea?
don't think it'll be a problem.
steady... steady... all right, mr. scott.
look. i'm ready to get the fuck out of here. it's real torture for me to be here. getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans.
oh i don't know, i think the tests work pretty well. sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
yes.
you treat folks special when they company. it's just supper, r.l., shit.
well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
no.  it's nice and cozy.
calm down, you're not ...
hmm?
even your fiancée...?
i'll be back in a couple of hours. and be careful with her, will you?
okay. i'm on the bridge.
car insurance costs money. cavities cost money.  doritos cost money.  i'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
you don't really think tuttle and the girl are in league?
so what'd we get her?
he already did, but i want god to forgive me too.
no signs of trouble?
where am i?
how's your wife?
give the guy a shot.
may i see your license?
i went to your place.  we talked, just like you told me.  we drove out into the desert . . .
let's go away.
jeff, stay there.
another one?
did you feel that?
ohhh-hh, ohhh...
what is that? oh my god, it's your conscience.
yes. how did...
yeeees?
where?
this is wrong in so many ways.
all of a sudden, i'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans i had for my life...
where's the radio?
what are you doing?
that's a real <u>fault</u>, i...
is this some kind of a joke?
so morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the klf?
my time isn't up yet.
jimmy?
oh, thank you.
why didn't they say that before you started?
i had... an experience.  of belonging.  of unconditional love. and for the first time in my life i wasn't terrified, and i wasn't alone.
the truth is most people don't have table manners today. and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
whoever that is.
wanna bet?
do you like music?
who was that?
how much are they paying you to be here?
memories of the future are just like any others.  i've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  you won't die of cancer, laurie.  there won't be time for that.
what's she doing?
drew is none of your damn business. nor is where i put my mouth.
he can't sit still.  just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
tim, tim, tim....
no. it's too soon.
but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. so don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
a million deaths are not enough for yueh...
but... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
well, we could try the bag over the head thing. walk you right out the front.
would you sign it for me.  i'm sure this is inappropriate.
well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
i had twenty thousand shares! i'd be a millionaire now!
here we have a typical barrack. it houses seventy-five men. every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
oh, you were excellent tonight, pony.
no, about... are you talking about duane cooley?
think this about money still, ya old fool?
...don't think so.  when they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  these guys are proud of what they did. they did dealey plaza!  they took out the president of the united states!  that's entertainment!  and they served their country doing it.
oh., no., sir. i was just assembling my notes.
well, i can help.
but where are you going?
no.  no bats, no flying.  they... float, occasionally.  not really flying.
hey, i know, it's hard.  but do what i do.
you drive a hard bargain, but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you.
oh, do you like it?  i'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
what do you want me to do? pick up after five dogs? i'm eighty-three years old. god in his heaven understands that i cannot pick up after five dogs.
elliot.
oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? spare me the uncle tom routine. you can't keep denying what you are. you're one of us, blade. you always have been.
don't feel too bad.  mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  you're better off out of it.
we allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. was we wrong?
i keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
got that.
you'll probably have them the rest of your life.
harm to whom?  me?  i don't think, so.  try him again at the hotel.
a plaque?
and that's how felicity came into the picture. during one of those two seconds.
okay, you've seen me. now go away.
how about the record room for any incident reports? he might be a victim. we can get medical records. check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
josh!
ha! who told you about the stardust ballroom?
... this is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. i mean, in my dreams you ...
certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
i will.
i tell you, i'm not interested in your opinion.
no, but they took my blender.
can i talk to you a minute?
yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
how did he do that?
then i'm afraid i don't understand.
i think so.
can you walk? puedes caminar?
lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  you're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... it's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  if we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
basically.  yeah.  if i go back now, i do a full thirty years, no time off. can you imagine looking at that?
war-mongering bully!  don't think you're going to intimidate me!
what're you guys doing?  huh?
what's the matter?
come on. harder.
all right -- it's said!
security consultant.
bunch of savages in this town.  hey, caitlin's in the back. you might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
and he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
i'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
it's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
least i'm not alone.
he knows it well.
catching a movie.
oh. oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think i'm awfully stupid. he slaps alex in the face.
joe, i thought i was gonna be all right by now, i just need a little more --
very good, mr. johnny.
well, let me have it.
that's too scary.
today ain't my day.
you're looking very chipper this morning, rose. sow do you feel?
you always did have style.
we got trouble.  that bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
about a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
you mean i generate an energy field?
mommy won't let me eat fast food. you know that. it's bad for you.
he's upset about adam. we're all upset.
what're you talking about?
oh, let's not talk about it.
sir?
ali?  what's wrong?
not a one. not one customer all day. i bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, i'm going straight down the skids. what do i want to be hiring someone for? i can't even pay my own wages.
verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, i didn't drop --
seymour scagnetti.
mrs. semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
the red sox are your problem. i never understood about you and the red sox. everybody rooted for the yankees.
there could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
go ahead!
you can't print that!
i'm not dragging you into anything. i don't expect...
here --   come on.
i'm so close i can feel it.
i'm scared shitless.
i ... it was terrible, i leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
take it back. till you sell your book.
...naw. made that up.
i swear to god, it works with lions sometimes!  there we are -- your baby is free --
things have been kind of stressful lately.
that don't sound like you, ma. you never was like that before.
hi. i'm matt hooper. if your husband is here, i'd like to talk to him.
looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
hello...

fifty cents admission.
hmm. to protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. the emperor knew, as i did, if anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
who is they, who is they?
"get the fuck out of my house."
i drug in a cot, if you want to stay.

i know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
"dear lisa. i've enjoyed working with you. i'd be lying if i didn't say i find you attractive. but in my heart i know that alice..."  you left my party to send e-mail?
paul, paul, a moment please.

i'd strongly advise you to join us--

the phone number of anna scott's agent in london and her agent in new york. you can ring her.  you think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
a signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. i think we'd know if held left.
i mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
yeah.
forget it.  i was joking.
what do you mean, dude?
why?
right there, between your eyes -- see? worry lines. you're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. how about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
stop limpin' around like that.
do you think they'll walk away?
you gotta be kidding!  this is unfuckingbelievable!  i have to start the evening crawling down capital records, i shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  next up, my guitar! the second most important thing i own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on hollywood boulevard!  then, then, after i burned up your brother, jazz... i should say as a fucking footnote i've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out domino's pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... tonight was different. i felt respect.  i felt love.  then jazz left me... and <u>now</u> i get to die!
you know, now that i hear myself tell it, i'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. what, you get the helmet monday through thursday, then brock takes it for the weekend...
good. where are we?
no. i'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
from now on, we'll share marla. we've been spending too much time apart...
say not here!  cuba!
seeing anyone in particular?
where's your car? i'll walk you to it.
polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in avril bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges. i couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.

seven o'clock.
on the high seas, your ship attacked, and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners.
yeah, you really don't like him.
hopeless i
how's my brother?
whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
what the fuck was that about?
no, words. you have never heard words?
so...would you object if i said you're quite striking?
wait just a minute.  what are you trying to pull?!
he gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
<u>you're surprised</u>!... but i guess i just never met the right guy.  whatta gonna do?
excuse me, sir. would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
have i told you what this man did?				*
he was my blood -- and i demand to know what happened to him.
the alarm will trigger if the system detects any non-w.a.s.p. tendencies inside the building. for example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
oh, ben gets through everything.
he ditched you.  you should've married me, you know.
there's just one thing more. if it weren't for miss dawson being here with me, i'd probably bump your heads together.
jody, she tried to kill him.
i don't know.
we're waiting, hubert.

i don't want to place you in any position --
mr. gale!

we're waiting for the jet car.  billy's bringing it.

jesus, bob.
i said it was bad judgment!  what else do you want me to say?
it was hermann goering. i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor, no questions asked. although dr. furtwängler stood up to him. and to dr. goebbels.
oh yes. i thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
ride with me.
"in absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."

i don't want to be paranoid... i mean, maybe it's a game. some kind of mind game.
he's got great hands.
you proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
most people don't have my kind of problems.
are you sure?
coffee?
where did the baby come from?
what are you afraid of?  turn it on.
looka that! two of them. oh my...
jesus christ ! how could you do this to him? how could you do this?
did you come?
lee, what the hell are you doing?
look, lady, that's enough. if you don't calm down. i'm going to throw you out. do you hear me? right now!
all right, outside!
hey...
[within] juliet!
i have this effect on lots of women.
thanks.
we have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. most of europe, the middle east and asia are battle ready.
boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
i can make you rich.
where's my ear?  who's seen my ear? did you see my ear?
that's lord frederick tessier. owns most of freeside. wintermute's mainframe is centred in the royal family's villa.
30   continued:
about the future.  you know - like a husband?  that's why i'm glad we're going to florida.
"really?"
what business is it of yours..?
how am i supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
this here money, take my share an' ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. tell 'em half goes to sally two trees if i ain't back in a week. the rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
are you alright?
are you finished?
my first husband worked for the bbc.  i doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc's independence during the suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  i became involved too.  i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez. then he died, and i loots the will to write it.  by the time i was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
john, you there?
a piece of pie on sunday.
he's coming ain't he?
dr. lester, it's been really fascinating, but i'm afraid i have to get home to my wife now.
beatrix, i want to ask you something.
but, mr. kane -
not unlike the way nicki met him. except it was a wrap party. why?
a what?
tell me, cindy. would you ever tell me "stop. if you loved me you'd stop."
it's the least i could do vic. i wish i coulda done more.  vic. toothpick vic. tell me a story? what're your plans?
probably got in cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
you mean like fucking two virgins at once.
mr. carter, merry christmas.
stop grousing. if we find the money i'll buy you an international conference all your own. now start looking. you take this side and i'll poke around over there.
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. and his eyes were open. that always bugs me out. do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
i'm thirteen. and i have a natural curiosity. it's only nature, rose, that's all. now what's wrong with nature, huh?
i have to see sen.  i've just been given a shift change.
break's over.
i guess this is what they call "ironee"? hunh?
why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
i never thought to ask. how can you ever forgive me?
marty,  i know i've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
what are you trying to say?
what... ?
good morning, mr. kirkeby.
but you do believe me?
bosen black.  flat.
you talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  i guess i'll have to talk to lieutenant bedsoe.
who is this man? you're engaged!
why? why do we have to do it?
how?
sure, i have. but not one with ice in it, that's all.
who cares ?
gordon cole?
now, listen. i'm in a very ugly mood. i put up a stiff battle for that seat. so if it's just the same to you—  scram.
...i mean, my mom's got insurance. what's the worst thing she could do? ground me for the entire year? i can handle that...
kelly.  what is it?
i saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. he didn't wash his hands.
and who is this?
i'll go. it's my fault.
i'm on the run!
it's just a bad flu, really. how did you know . . .
hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. don't make no difference no-how.
what'd you do before this, anyway? wait-- let me guess. ice sculpture? rock?
here's my signature -- here preysing, sign here.
steve...
they can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. there's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
who, can you think, who would want to harm dr. fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
you think i want a baby? when you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
what the hell for?
i'm sorry, but i just can't see you veggin' out in la-la land.
i couldn't say, sir... captain henderson?
first, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  second, you don't have to decide today.  take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  one day, the game begins.  you either love it or hate it.  decide then.  we're like an experimental book-of-the-month- club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  that was my sales pitch.
andy, c'mon in!  thanks for flyin' out here!!
i don't think i want any.
yes. have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
what was she like?
it's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
uh-huh.
me?
i don't feel anything.
about you... your background and your qualifications. i'm afraid phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
but what happens if instead of this... ultimate warrior... it is evil who stands here?
i am not living with him.  i've just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i'm doing. look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  you know that, don't you?  i left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  and i suddenly realized that i like my job, and i like what my life is could be turning into, and that i'm getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, i sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run.  probably nothing.
what ya want?
why not?
an honor, gentlemen.  in time i will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
that was foolish of me. why didn't you shove me away?
yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
what'd they call her in high school?
the real story on miss carpenter.
the dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
if everything hadn't happened the way it has, then i wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
won't he be able to tell?
no. i want to know why you're here in berkeley?
i know...and i'm really sorry.
i don't know. it all gets back to that cynthia thing. i don't like her... eagerness. there's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
i heard what you said, spooky. i can't believe he shot you...
great. i'll pick you up around eight o'clock. is that good?
tell him i have a fiancée, dickie has a fiancée and freddie miles probably had a string of them.
it's there. the boss called, you said so yourself.
we're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
yes. he's a good kid. maybe a little messed up.
of course!  roy bensinger, the poet. of course you wouldn't know! you probably never heard of shakespeare, either! put mr. bensinger right on the staff.  how much are you getting on the tribune, roy?
sorry. i'm still getting the hang of this.
you gave them me.
take the squad ahead.  we'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
no students work for me.
the clothes are not important...
cute nickname, don't you think?
over the black sea. i can probably get us to turkey or georgia.
i know, father.
more fun win battle?
is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
mr. appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the united states congress. believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
so long, baxter. we know you won't let us down.
space stattion 5 - lounge
we stay down here.
haven't seen you since the surrender.  come to think of it, i didn't see you <u>at</u> the surrender.
we talked earlier about your mother. and we talked about your father and his death. and i don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but i have to ask and i would want to clarify something -- something that i understand --
grace, listen... you've got to do this. just trust me one more time.
release the sharks!  all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. i figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
it's enough now.
paul's grandfather.
you didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
are you serious?
i'd kill it.
easy, son.  you just need to get your feet back under you, that's all.  come on, boy, let's kick south.  down to the old playground.
is that what the guy in the sunday school suit is doing outside?
he won't be back until monday. i mean, if those birds are for him....
just a tip.
so ambrose has bellerophon and mccloy's got chimera.
that's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
ballast.
he's a freak.
but, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
augie's going to grow up here. there's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
well, there was this one time --
i should pass, but i'll trail along--i'll take three. 
yes?
all right, i guess.
what is it you got between you?
smack him back.
i'll take three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
after eight years in the jungle with you, i know mrs. wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe!
boy, that was a rough one.
the greasy pole.
it's no big deal.
i don't want it anymore.
he's really very short on charm.
it is?
tis not fit for a princess.
it's a whatzis?
it was the mall.
yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
can you now? aah ... sheeps' heads! you learn more by getting out there and living.
you know her?
and what about the reconfiguration?
but i've seen the deed.
knox, i don't believe this!
but if it got late and i hadn't shown up?
okay.
diphenyl parlene.
are you freaking out?
aha.  james giving some woman the old heave-ho.
you told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. i gave you three. what happened?
lisa works at the mgm grand...
why do you need a radio?
in case you need me to testify about the shooting. they'll clear you.
did you hear something?
no, i think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
daddy!!!
i feel like i do.
...apartment.   no, no. please.  you don't know who we're dealing with, i, please believe me, they...
get it through your head, little girl; i'm not going for you.  if this toby likes you, then if i were you i'd marry him.  you're not going to get much better in this town.
negative. the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
no, we checked his story with a tipster.  he was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
daniel burdon, please.  karen sisco.
an insolent penny-a-page rogue, marlowe, he said, christopher marlowe--has he been to the house?
but i just -- look -- what if mr. robinson walked in right now?
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer.  here, here's a number of an immigration lawyer.  that's how you help her. but you can't get involved in her like that.  you're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  and lemme give you another piece of advice.  maybe you don't watch tv but i'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  and when you get out there, they know your face.  and the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  and i get more done because of it.
well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
see? happy? you dumb bitch? are you happy, you dumb bitch?
yes ...  make sure ...
no. i just need some space, maybe.
man, it's so hot.
where's your shell collection?
i confess.
you won ten dollars. big deal. if we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
i'm okay.
it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
what?
oh yes, i saw. poor child.
i have no luggage.
that was your people magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
wires... metal, cold... something soft...
right away... instantly!
you need a maid.
where do you want this?
uh, we're just, starting our program...
you should talk to elaine.  that was her best friend.
cincinnati country day.
this is nuts.
who?
what'd you come back for, babe?
if it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  i'll work on it.
[because he's outside. because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
where you stand?
now?
i thought she met your father in luxemburg.
and don't be walking off with any of that. you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
you said it!
right now, we're inside a computer program?
i know.
i... do not want this...
yeah ... sullivan thinks henry's leaking.  he's the one ...
our faithful friend is still there.
we're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. count it out the back. i don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
...well i'll be damned.
<u>i'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
eh... yes.
suggestion! hypnotic suggestion! why didn't i think o~ that before?
i just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
phones are out too.
i've got 'em!  they're back on my screens!
yeah, i know! but for the moment you're not yet a woman. so, be patient... i need time... and you too. you have to grow up.
you watch him, al, i s...s...stutter!
you should have seen georgie's face when he met clayton.
cobb, you've got nothing i need.
come on, dad.  you could have rick drive down cunningham road and look for them.
the way i acted, in the snow...you must think i’m a coward.
oh, paul, this is so romantic. ian and windthorne dueling for the right to misery's hand. does ian win? oh, don't me. it's windthorne, right?
would it be painful for you?
there's no catch. this is on the up and up. of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by anne schuyler's husband.
i'm on the phone.
would you suffer through a dance with me?
damn!
calf love. i loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
how <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
you were asked to have a glass of wine. sit down!
i finished all the interviews.
i thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
demon! demon! that's why you can walk on it! demon!
why wasn't i involved from the beginning?  you and i started fight club together.
what happened?
you just wouldn't. it's not the amish way.  but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night.
or your fucking wife, you know.
for now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. the books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  and, these murders have been like forced attrition.
i'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  you people were once heroes. you had ideals.  you fought for things.  spooky told me so...
no!
darling!...you will be careful!?
look, jim...  okay.  i know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  but now it's different.  jim, what i'm trying to tell you is that tracy and i are totally, totally in love.
order chinese for us and meet me the library?  anything but beef.
...give me protection?
i guess.  you're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
yes.
in fact the only thing which looks like dickie is you.
you moved any slower, you'd grow roots...we've got a schedule...shake it, man....
fortuitous even.
gotta be here someplace.  thought i heard a couple of dead christians singing down there.
cut the 'bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
huckleberry hound?
...noon.
thanks for the invite.
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
how deep does it get?  that water's cold and i can't swim.
who we are. don't you think they're going to be pissed?
what do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? you're just gonna do something you'll regret...
i guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
oh, all right.
so this boat of yours...that's what you do? give people...rides.
what do you want me to tell you, monica, to go beat that girl up?  to go have sex with him?  i'm not going to do that. yes, i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  if that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
well, that is a strong opinion.
what is it my son?
am i out of here?
i tagged the goddamned stocking. it ain't lost.  we're sequestering that evidence.  that's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
he told you.
i was washing my stockings, so i decided i might as well do your socks.
what about her?
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud
i think you know what i mean.
i rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to atlantic city.
3000 feet. i'll do it.
a film case.
shit. what about tomorrow?
how much is your soul worth if you don't?
well i'm certainly not, either.
was the paralysis immediate?
that would seem to be the question of the hour.  i want to build it, doctor.  of course i'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as i said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. i need someone on the inside.
you want onions?
what about it do you like? i'm not being critical, i'd really like to know.
uh-huh.
i'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
i thought there were people here....
you know the ancient tongues?
and that is why i must go.
sir!... might i inquire if general webb has heard from colonel munro's daughters? i was to rendezvous with them in albany and escort them to the fort.
fuck it.  i'm not counting it again.
she's hotter'n a heifer.
he --
we volunteered?
that's a lie!  they want me, they want me!  i get letters every day!
why wouldn't they?  look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
stevie... i can't...
larry, can i borrow your car keys?
i don't know. i only saw one.
are you okay?
she can't be here without me.
well, she doesn't complain much. you know what she's like.  she keeps asking when you're coming...
bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  have you seen my glasses?
i'm your family.
buffy, honey?
oh, a d-girl. you know... i have a really great idea for a screenplay.
in a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
we're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
looks like you went quite a distance.
my voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
don't worry, i'll be right back.
put the key in and turn it.  the right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
well, they must be something sexual, because ann gets freaked out by that shit. are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
do you?  then why don't you go out? meet someone.  make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
you have him in restraints.
they're sitting in the dark, goofing on the christmas tree.
twelve months in oak.
right on.
those are good burgers, walter.
it's about that meteor.  they say it's a whopper.  the district officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. thought you might be interested... it's ten or twelve miles from here - over by linda rosa.
i thought i'd show you one of my favourite places.
...hello?
of course it is.  and i'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  maybe mine, maybe yours.
is this crazy?
help me sid! the killer's got me!
it isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady. now he's got them to cancel the fair.
is he out?
i'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  call the group.  schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
please.
you want that?
why don't i want to do this?
part of me says i should just look at this as a perk.  you know, a bonus.  but then i remember you're you -- deirdre who used to belong to the ira -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
your wife?
congratulations, dick.
you wouldn't be in the way.  i like having you around.
sorry.
keep talking....
any sign of rape?
well, you're to take these after you've eaten. now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
i spent all evening on the mainframe. lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. no record of anyone named mofet. but "split city" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. i tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  it's a mini-storage facility outside baltimore, where lecter had his practice.
he's the only one who can operate this --
were you right? spock? v'ger is a living machine...?
gotta go with the belt there...
there are some things that are unclear. we need to talk.
father, i--
we have to get off this beam!
inez, this is --
the who?
they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
something happened.  you got nuked in the last quarter.
vincent <u>farrell</u>, assistant u.s. attorney.  a passenger in this taxicab, and i'm reporting you to the dmv...
come on. i wancha to meet a frienda mine. raymond, get enough beer for ben too.
tell me the words.
wait a minute. all right. hold on.
what do you want me to say?  i'm in prison.  you should know.  you put me here.
administration, ensign blondell.
you play games with me and you're through
oh, yeah?
no.
what she look like?
i'm only ten years old.
i can't. i got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and i haven't slept and--  where to -- ?
did you say something?
madge?
no... i mean, will you go with me? that's like... what they call it here. going together.
so our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - a two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
it's locked.
be ready at two --
now margo, don't overreact.  cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  my leaving makes perfect sense.  this isn't exactly early retirement.  i've overstayed the party a bit.
we had a leak in the bathroom. he fixed it.
but i can't be dry.
you have a bay?
i'd love to.
sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
i don't like this, this...
they'll soon be over.
bye, uncle cort.  what's with the lie?
you're talking about complicity.
there may be a hunting party.
what did he sound like on the phone?
that's my father. i got to run.
what's that?
i want out.
it's the only pose i have left. i'm sunk. broke. i don't even have my hotel bill.
you a friend of lime's?
are you frightened?
bullshit! that's bullshit!
my mom drinks, too... why do people drink, creasy?
brain. soul, i'm telling you, lotte. i was right inside him looking out. we're going to be rich.
do not let the waters touch you.
and what about you?
more than enough.
well?  didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
don't you have to be here?
but --
they're from good stock on their mother's side.
you want to go outside?
me too.
what are you talkin' about?
yes and no.
that-that won’t do. that’s not the way it goes. you saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which i still cannot believe.
is that so?
....relax roget  you're 82m in the account numbers and i'm the invisible man... they're always looking for red flags, gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
how old is he?
one of your people told me.
someone lost the key.
how do you like santa carla?
they don't belong to anybody.
i'm afraid that's impossible.
i can't guarantee you what it will be. but i swear on my life, i'll find you work.
what?!
get out of there!!! get out!!! put your hands up, on your head. go on!!! get down on your knees - do it!! what are you doing? who are you? what's your name? what's your name?
i've come to dinnnnnner!
what do you suggest?
nobody can be that busy.
i could, but it's confidential.  look, the point is, we didn't talk.  i told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
brainstorm, buzz. i admit, i thought it was a rotten idea, but i put up the scratch.  and now we got a beautiful thing.
you do though. you look really... is that a wonderbra?
woah!!
then what?  exactly.
carefull those are dirty words! you sound like a bunch of new york critics.  thank you, miss schaefer.
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg. your father is waiting for you there patiently. i will speak to you further when i come.
i have the highest gpa in delta gamma!
current levels may not be sufficient.
there was a time when i would have welcomed it.
we already know each other. hey, brenda.
sherry   sherry  sheerrry. ...
oh. gee, you're swell! oh.
a sweet man.
do you talk to holly or lee behind my back?  do you?  you must.  they- they seem to know so much about us.
my name's salvatore...and yours?
woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
his name was arturo marquez. a petty smuggler out of argentina. he was arrested in new york last year for trafficking. he escaped to california and got picked up in long beach. they were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. get this - edie finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
because of your phone calls.
no you are not.  you're sally nash. listen to me, you're sally nash.  you're my best friend and i love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to london to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "oh now i'm a novelist, oh now i'm a director..." english prick bastard joe therrian who's probably going to leave you for skye davidson anyway.
surely you knew this was coming.
because i'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
those solar winds are flaring, but i factored them into my coordinates and --
she said "none the better, you all go to hell..."
you saw my fa... father? when?
the bedroom.
i don't know.  they killed wes.
uh...yeah...sorry.
this is the answer: a subscription drive to "voice of action!" first prize is a trip to moscow! you could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet stanislavski!
you're amazing, olsen. a boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. then superman puts out a fire on third avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
hi.
yeah, but i see you moved it up.
because they are here.  because tsavo is the worst place in the world.  come, john- to the bridge. 
oh, christ. escobar, you don't know what's going on. let her go. i'll explain it later.
what you see is what i got, mister.
what the hell are you doing here?
cut that out, copper.  nauls?  what's taking you?!
i don't back down.
and if i use them to kill you?
pattee?  that your middle name?
alright.
then what are you scared of, honey?
you'll have to send us a postcard.
my truck can't be more than ten feet away. we load into the back, i can get in the front and we roll out of here.
no. don't answer it!
can you keep sam straight?
if i'm the king of israel, i say to myself, king, i say to myself, king... take a good look around. what do i see?
i carried the king's child!  the queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
i had a witness i would.
i tried again and got through.
you sent for me, sir?
trip? you just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to kiss live at cobo hall tonight!
a criminal, captain -- a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering --
get out of here!
i know.
hot. where do i sign?
i made macaroni.
i'm done.
oh. that.  don't waste time with your queen.
you're not going anywhere.
what was that about?
was it the same oswald, dave, that was in dallas, or was it an impersonator.
you're the sphinx.
what do you think?
<u>don't touch him, watch it</u>!
they're coming!
we don't need to think bad thoughts, do we mama?
you haven't seen her yet?
okay.  it's west.
that's what i'm askin'.
[i know this. your point?]
fine. welcome. come sit down.
a woman?
it was great.
i believe the operation is over.
then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  i've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  i'm going to bring that boy back.
well, who says life is fair? where is that written? life isn't always fair.
that is not true. they have tried to help me.
it never is. but he's my brother.  we're going to california together. but first we're going to stop in silverado and see our sister. and i can't show up there with a story like this.
you had a plan! you had a goddamn life! and she just fucked the guts out of you!
oh, i was just wondering, if i were to bring in chirino, would you put me on the task force?
yes, but where?
next wednesday i grab a grand from snyder. an' thursday two yards from cappoli, okay?
on tv ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
andy, who is that guy?
he's not home.
my name's hawkeye pierce.
this is your bedroom?
shut up?  shut up???  mom never did that.  mom never said shut up to me.  mom never yelled at me.
let's go.
jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
you will do as i tell you. you will try to reach ynyr, the old one.
how are you feeling about work?
i'm an artist, alura. my work comes first. other people come second.
oh, i see.
oh yeah.  the one that used to confess to everything?  hoping we'd beat him up?
how you doin'?
what the hell are you pissin' about, i'd like to know?
i just wanted to scare em.  so i go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if i really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
look! why don't you run out and play? the sun's shining.
i'll call her up.
what was it called, sir.
yeah, i finally "checked out", thank god. but there's a bit of unfinished business.
i'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
yeah.
what happened after you smelled it?
we'll stay at the plaza --
i like stories.
thank you.
will you stand still so i can do this!
no. they're at the franklin hint expo at the skokie holiday inn.
charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. we've trusted you with our daughter.
what?! no please, sir --
that candy--she's the nicest girl i know!
kambucha mushroom tea...
like an old hambone?
they?
what're we going to do?
a bargain buy, from china. ten cents each, i'll get a dollar.
hi, mickey...
no what?
why? why have you got to go round killing and looting?
they're never going to see you.  you're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
... make plain the last resting place of the most holy grail.
i haven't used anything for two days. i'm trying.
a man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. is that somethin' you agree with?
quiet, mollie!
i could run off them whores.
what do you know?
how was chicago?
you shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. it's bad for you.
so did you. goodbye, jeff.
i've been dreaming about you.
uh, yeah.  sure.  honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
you'll never make it.
c'mon...
i can't remember.
:what, you're doing darcy? since when?
... gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. the scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american. but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... kinney, what did you come up with?
gerald wants to see him first.
very appropriate.
did he say a wolf?
i like that one.
hi. i'm here for the big show?
let me say somethin' first...
fabulous!
it was jessica. that girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
i made it go down the toilet.
yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. he's sick.
well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
good.
what's cookin', bert?
what? what do you want?
i begin to believe in it myself since i've met you. i still don't know what to make of it. it confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, ninotchka.
two down, four to go.
goddammit, hardy, you can't just leave --
delivering gossip and goodwill. it seems we'll both be doing brighton.  perhaps you should come too.
are you sure?
yeah!
but suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. how will you survive?
i thought steve had talked to you?
nothing.
i don't know how.  because he's different than we are.  because he's a space guy.  what do you want from me, anyway.  go ask blair.
<u>you</u> did this?  you carved all these little figures and houses and things?
well, id'n that nice.
i'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
oh, man... this is bullshit!    you can't trust anyone these days.
sarah.  sarah, this is dr. silber- man.  i'd like you to tell him everything reese said to you.  do you feel up to it?
that's the way i want it.  just turn the radio on and go.
sorry.  you look great.  i'm totally exhausted.
i could always get us a bottle.
you're looking well, jean-luc. rested.
god, you're anatomically correct!
let me up! let me up!
who says you ain't supposed to?
you won't live to see it.
this place is built like a fortress.
you know, i was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  how are your kids handling the new house?
are you now?
what did you come back for?
you know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
i'll come by tomorrow after work.  with dinner.
well this is your business, benjamin.  if you --
probably makes it worse. dehydrates you even more.
when donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
don't get me wrong. a couple years ago, i woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. but the lord's been good to me. i can now finance any films i choose. big ones, small ones. right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. live sound. i like to keep my own money in my films. that way you don't have to share the profits. there's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. but if i was you, mr... what was your name again?
so?
refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, fletch.
ben?
she's putting the titty back.
then they took the mercedes away -- with his body in it.
uh-huh.
how did you know they were stockings?
don' need you okayin'.
any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
you can't be william starks. he's dead.
i don't know what she's talking about. i never said any such thing.
good god, boy! yell!
nope.
will you give this to him.
good morning.
when?
hey!
oh god.  i'm really crazy.
to forget? don't be so motherly, midge. i'm not going to crack up.
you, uh, you ever been to louisville during derby week, miss, ah, packard?
what do you mean?
fellas, i'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
when did you deliver this first?
and how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
i, you know, they should be insured.
i understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, doctor.
you okay?
who'd you call?
if you ever touch my minivan again, i'll make you sorry. real sorry.
...and the desk sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? can you believe that? you weren't even charged. new york police - jesus. i want to take pictures of your face to bring to the d.a. first thing in the morning.
perfect.  sandbag the father.
i figured.
goose is dead.
an ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
get dressed, scully.
we need some help.  i found something this morning.  here. emergencies.  'in case of emergency, draw door.'
<i>network</i>.  yeah, she was good.
say my name!  what's my name!?
i thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
can i ask you a personal question?
and that is how you talk to a girl, rat. voila. you can't miss.
what about your knocking off for lunch?
probably.  one of the many.
yeah.
you will please permit mr. deeds to finish.
what is mac out?
yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
we?  what the fuck we?  you said you just wanted to come along--
are you on drugs right now?
sure--they're sorta queer, i'd say. they's lots of queer goings on up there. they even brought a dog back to life once.
i don't know what to do! i don't know what to do! crap. crap...
i was looking forward to seeing him.
jeff you have company!
i felt the same way before i got married.  confused.  scared.
wouldn't miss it.
data?
no way out.  no way out.  what?  who?
good luck, captain.
boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  i'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  did you tell joanna she should leave me?
but the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
i've seen lots of people.  it's not a big thing for me.
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died -- that day at the beach.
hear that?  are you hearing this?
can i ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
just for your information, ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
what's his story?
i'd know him anywhere.
did he pay?
i'd miss my life...
it's not me?
a hot story, huh?
maybe there's fingerprints on it?
oh, so i'm the bad guy now?
funny, i don't feel lucky.
i thought we were talking about sidney?
mick, i know it's late, but there is a problem.  they haven't shown up yet.
i'm totally blown away. you're getting married. it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex.
believe what you saw, matthews. the dog was dead.
you have corey and dc.  i have my dad.
recall any names?
this is your history, isn't it? nicky? all around us. and my parasite is consuming it.
you did good, kay-em. i'm proud of you.
maybe more.
what the heck is this?!!
what?
come on, professor. the army's not gonna give you any answers. you'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
i don't get it. how come there's no rock 'n roll?
what can i do?
just speculating, i guess.  how do you think it started?
oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
they're methodical.  they're nothing if they're not that.
the meeting is arranged.  captain best is waiting for you now.
it's the truth, i swear.
mr. jefferson carver?
i can't, andy.
it's a plain end. i think.
you did what?  who did you talk to? what for?
no.
i want to.
besides, if i lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which i do not--i wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. i'd do it myself.
well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
that's right.
hit ain't got no gas in it.
jessica, can you drive me home?
no, you're wrong.  it's just beginning. come on, have a drink. show your big brother how it's done.
madame vice president. we have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off lee, and reads it as she talks.
[beat] listen, i hate to bother you...
what are you doing?
what's that?
many men here, their homes are in the path.
i'm concerned about her health.
hey, pete.
what?
mrs. lampert, i'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
you were-you were sensational. i mean, i-you know, i-i told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, i-i-you- you were sensational.
must be your upper lip, 'cause i don't smell nothing.
gus, tell me, have you ever heard of vulcan?
it's my own way. it works for me. i don't care about the rest of that stuff.
so it's love which drags you to moscow.
you see that? you wanna be like that?
anyone.
let me get your change.
she's there, just like i said she'd be.
southern california.
i told you, use less powder.
this stuff's deadly -- i hope we know what we're doing.
you've changed your mind? you do want to play?
i have to go home, sanchez.
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that. just like you questioned him.
i don't know what came over me.
here we are. you'll be all right here, miss.
thanks for noticing.  it used ta be peaceful before they got out.  took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
no...
you guys awake?
really. you'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no mcp looking over your shoulder.
listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? this is a matter of principle. something you probably wouldn't understand.  when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
hello.  can i help you?
is this the key to the attic?
she's refused to say a word to anyone. what made you think you could get her to talk?
il est en retard.
in other words, god is one hell of an engineer.
then... what?
we've been together too long.  his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
martin, look at me.
taylor, i'd rather you -
uh huh, i wanna be a writer.
for what?
so that means it's alright for you to act like that?
you can also describe its cure. i'm eating its cure.
is that the man i knew, treasurer sanchez?
if i'm anything like you, i'll deserve him.
dad, i'm hoping we can talk about some things while i'm here.
pretty, isn't it?
she went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
we've got to find him.  i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  and you stay here, norbert, in case he comes home.  that's all he said--the thing about the key?
this time i really don't see anyone man.
where's sarah? where are the boys?
yeah.
no, her dog!
i'd really like to see you.
you're crying, animal.
uh-huh... so, what'd you talk about?
i was born.
you threatening my family, now, too?
com'on, just say it. try it on for size.
how'd you get this from her?
'cause harlin used to own it.
won't you even make a try for it, mr. andrews?
is that how larry feels?
detectives, what is this about?
no it's not the only issue. there's another issue, for the jury. what about entrapment?
from the club. you didn't answer.
bruise?  oh, yes. it's better.
so far.
clive had a job. i didn't. i couldn't.
we're in the wrong place.  we're wasting time.
william starks is dead... [beat] i've been to his grave.
that doesn't make any sense.
is her husband sick or something?
francoise -
onions?
why not? there's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. i don't see why i shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
no substitutions.
what about o-2?
sandro, i don't want you to come with me, i don't want to see you... how can i make it clear to you?...why did you come?
free to come and go as you please. there's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
well?
oh - uh - nothing.
get him out of there.  i thought i told you people --
we are lost.
he begged me to marry him.  i didn't even want to marry him.
happy birthday, nicholas.
how did it end?
no!
joel, i'm not a concept. i want you to just keep that in your head. too many guys think i'm a concept or i complete them or i'm going to make them alive, but i'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. don't assign me yours.
you sure your friend got the right place?
i thought he was in prison, in england.
jesus! they're all gonna be calling me!
i'm okay. i just lost my balance.
have you been waiting long?
alright, let's check it out.
of course. only i'm afraid you'll be cheated. there isn't much of a view of the procession here.
i don't know.  it just happened.  i was here ten years ago, i'm here now.  that's it.
uh-huh.
i'm not dead. i am not dead.
what kind of test?
a surgeon might...
not in those words.
not really.  i mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  that's what all our friends think, anyway.
sally, for christ's sake.
i don't know.
well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
i've set my laser from stun to kill.
if ever i meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  i'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
oh, yeah ? i don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
i'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  you guys get to the memorial.   keep this stuff hidden.  the last thing we need is some over-zealous secret service twirp to...
hi.
let's rush him.  he's not going to blow us all up.
you bet.  we all can't be such modern people 
call donovan, marcus. tell him i'll take that ticket to venice now.
yes -- tired...
no.
i'm a bad person.
i can't man.
had to be him.
oh, yeah.
oh, come on, amado--
it's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
oh, good.
you've lost your mind.
what thing could we be in together?
just stay away from me, okay?
you're right.
about who?
will you let me go then?
cops.
breaking out
nah, i musta missed it.
well, i'm glad to see you. sorry things broke up like that.
i'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
you like to sit down?
i'm not hanging. i'm fixing my car --
no, no, we haven't the time. talk prose. where is my play?
well, suppose he does?
this is terrible! this can't be happening!!
apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. entirely too much like myself. do you follow so far?
that's good. you're learning. but let me tell you why i know she was lying.  first off, betty would never fall for a soap star. it's beneath her.
that's all we did, steal their ride.
well... sort of...
a thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  these creatures from planet 10 are ready to exploit soviet-american tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
i'm dr. eugene sutphin. what's the trouble, officer?
it's been here seventeen years. did you live here before or something?
susan, i really think -
it was hers. it was built for her. many years ago.
oh, he was. he told me a magic spell that would make you come.
oh -- mrs. lieberman.
what are <u>you</u> doing?!
and left from my dreaming was a feeling of un-nameable dread.
they go. john. they go.
i...can't.
you think i'm shitting you...
i did.  he wants it on exhibit.
what do you think you're doing ?
we going somewhere?
what the hell? what kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
...is everything okay?
tapestries?
which two?
give me some leads.  i'm going out... i'm getting out of...
that's the call that i'm waiting for.
so what do you make of it?
my grandmother's rich.
doug?
i tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
look, i do matrimonial work, it's my metiay.  when a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
what's in your socks?
nobody but you can do that to me. i don't know why.
no, wait...
it's tommy! they got tommy!
sorry. what are those cards?
pack up. i'll see you get back to london.
from now on, you'll respond only to the name "jay." you'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the ins special services. you're not to stand out in any way.  understand?
i got a call from ross this morning. cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. they found tom grunemann's body buried there. they've notified his wife.
uh-huh.
fantastic ! a little faster sweetheart.
well, i'll miss riding home with you. i was looking forward to it.
i don't talk that way.
these bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  all we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
yes, ma'am.
...freddie! what's the matter? you've been like this all evening.
i'm serious, honey. don't get out of my sight, all right? i want you to stay right by me. will you do that for me?
how come you don't took familiar?
according to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of andrew beckett's work. do you remember saying that?
the chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
embezzling ? i'm not embezzling !
that's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  after the thirtieth. murray and mitch.  after the contest.
wait a minute - let me out.
yes, yes--phone, phone--  a--an outrage, pet--an outrage--i'll look into this--  hello--joe!--what!--no! not really! terrible!
murder willie? in my heart, he was our child. victor's and mine. such a thing could never have entered my mind.
it just occurred to me that i've never snuck through your bedroom window.
how often they come here?
listen up.  you two are married as of now.  get used to it.
you ever handle a pistol like this, samuel?
lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. i need something to persuade her that i was there. get me something to take to her.
malkovich.
you didn't really believe me, did you?
oh nice save.
please! you wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
okay. if you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
it's a sign that you're crazy!  do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
where are we going ?
so...we won?
yes.  and that one, too.
yo. check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 bps modem!
we'd only just met.
where do you think you're going?!
that's not me. i didn't... i'm not doing that.
no.
robert bain, driving me!  jesus fucking christ!
you take one more step, i'll kill her.
look... i don't know what your problem is...
what happened?
gee, thanks.
a long time ago. you've repaid them many times over. ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
did you play recently?
you know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the tv - but i'm not you know - they are - i don't watch it for entertainment every night - i don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? she was dead - i can't hurt something dead - and all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - i couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
you okay?
you newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? what is it you call him - the cinderella man?
all right, kent. i just hope you know what you're doing. if you really think smallville is your big chance, go for it.
your majesty, i urge you not to see this woman.  it all reeks of a burgundian trap!
is harvard gettin' all that money?
i gotta get you out of here.
and how would you know that?
what?
i mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
how long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
how did you know we'd come here?
you are not a god.
jews don't celebrate christmas, tom.
did you miss me?
if you get lonely, go down and see mrs. romari. i told her you were staying with me.
you.
with the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  redwood forests.  oceans. mountains --
i take it this file is still open.
how many men?
gimme the ball!
i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along?
what's that?
remember, george, "it is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
ask her if she knows how i might reach him?  if she has a telephone number?
the marriage already ended.
four hundred, four fifty -
rise...and...shine...!
why?
someone got hurt.
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. which is seldom.
yeah, it's me.
we? don't blame me!
george... i'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  but short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, i don't know what else to do.  'cause i've always got to be one step ahead of them.

well, it was my freshman year at princeton - there was this girl - her name was nellie - her father was vice-president of hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  that summer we spent our vacation at the grand canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - i took off my glasses - i took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
he had you down as a big-timer. what happened?
i said, i come to town with a girl.
who is this . . . superman?
i think i recognize you.
<u>you</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
what's got billy so spooked?
what do you mean?  what's he do?
i'll report you.  it's....
just tell me now; where's the money hid?
stupid!  is wendy hood your girlfriend?
i'll have it in a week.
so, in other words, you are not down.
her doctors murdered her. they gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  her doctors murdered her.
darn it!
i'm sorry, sir. our clientele is restricted to white anglo-saxons.
move!
he wants your wisdom.
i gave my key to the gate to todd, but the dudleys'll be here in the morning.
didn't see the war.  i was born after, in the ruins.  grew up there.  starving.  hiding from the h-k's.
the pages are gone. that's real.
but what if something extraordinary happened?  something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  someone whose confirmation of phillippe the king would never be questioned.
oh, of all the foolish... listen, do you take shorthand? are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
more bullets in the gun?
what would be true, then.
pumpkin, are you in there?
seven terraces of purgation.
on a lot of lithium?
the most respected ...
c'mon, cut it out.
kinda like men.
so... smell... is... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  and a memory can trigger a smell.
i wish you wouldn't say that....
what else is there for me? 
get it?
if we find ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned b.a.r. back to the beach for me.
come on you can do better than that!
die?  what...?
oh --
do they have an x-rated channel?
but here you are inside, aren't you?
erin. it's not your fault.
well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
good evening.  forest service.
attrition.  when you regret your sins, but not because you love god.
am i... disturbing you?
what's the matter?
what the hell did you think you were doing?
what'd you get? you get leniency?
that obvious, huh?
you saved my life.  you could have run, but you didn't. you saved me.
well, it can really only go two ways.
so get him outta your life. get out of michigan. they got perfume counters in chicago, don't they?
yes, i can tell that just looking around.  "boy?"  did you say you were a "country boy?"
the woman you shot. she was my friend.
easy now, miss, i've got you???
with what?
indy? did you talk to them?
they're only trying to scare you, that's all.
i'll say anything you want me to say. i fuckled salvy. i fucked tommy. i fucked your brother. i fucked everybody! what do you want to hear? i sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
i ain't worn it since our divorce came through. it must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. never thought i'd need it; vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
lucky, i guess.
it has to be at sophie's. she didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
then why are you doing it? how much better can you eat? what can you buy that you can't already afford?
vito!  pino!  let's go.
barber, right? i'm freddy riedenschneider. hungry? they tell me the chow's ok here. i made some inquiries.
huh.
you know your morse code almost as well as i.
oh, bill, i'll keep it. i'll keep it with me all the time.
i am no one's wife.  i live in my own house.  i do not live in a man's house.  he has a wife.  we are together.  i am free.  because of banking and finance and travel...  and i can do anything i want...
come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
what's your name, giant?
she wasn't diabetic. you think i don't			 * know my own wife? what the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
where!
pacifica, california... that's a long ways away.
the references are to hansard or to newspapers.  i haven't got the actual speeches now.  you'll have to chase them up.
timmy this is gerry, an old friend of mine. we went to college together.
what? life's beautiful. depression isn't permanent. don't you believe that?  what is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
well, yeah, i suppose. sure. i just had a little business to settle with mr. gordon. i'm the local police officer.
well, i always painted. always. and my mother always encouraged it. she was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... i was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. she used to pose nude for me... and i thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
-- then perhaps, the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld.
what is it?
no -- i love you so much and i want you to promise me something.  i don't want you to ever worry about me.  if anything should happen, i'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- and i have no regrets.
uh-huh. to carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
you know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
william.
he ask you out for next weekend?
i told you that was an accident!
curt cobain.
that's ridiculous.
you callin' him a liar?
i'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  say, you might be able to help me.  when she used to talk about kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about rosebud?
the black beverly hills. i knew this lady from ladora heights once.  "hi, i'm from ladora heights, it's the black beverly hills."
i guess i'm a little paranoid.
...so?
you have no conception of this, do you?
maybe i can turn it into a bit.  i can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  demand a recount...
brown hair, is it?
i vant to suck your blood. i also vant to suck your twinkie.
sod it, it's broken!
what's he doing?  answer me!
now, wait a minute, chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for god's sake don't give up on yourself! you have to fight! you can't let those bastards keep you down! i don't want to hear any more from you about the 'room upstairs'. that's where i'm going soon.
oh that was... no, i ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. it's you. i want you.
knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. his lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
i know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, billy. stupid.
that's a shame.
but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor, from the tigris-euphrates valley to the mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. i've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. i have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
not a clue. you?
dr. frock.  did you hear that?
it's my father, gone a-hunting.  the baron couer de noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
of course.
i say we call it in.  get some backup.  but you gotta do it.  harp won't listen to me.
i'm not an intellectual.... i mean, i read, but... fund-raising isn't what i...
this is a brutal layoff...and all because they couldn't program wednesdays.
yeah, i did.
i don't know.  they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
but i just met you.
those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him.
it's not his fault, evan. you knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
back to california
it is.
what are you doing?
that's what i thought.
have you partied with him?
we were afraid.  silence seemed better.  to come forward seemed like a mistake.
how's business, bruce?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
don't cry, laurie...i understand how it is...i'll just go 'way...
with a jacked-up attitude.
from now on you'll be history
we'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  whatever you want, we'll work it out. i promise.
yes. it is unfortunate.
geez, mrs. haydn, we just got going.
we've got to get that valve turned off. their oxygen is almost gone...
and you're not one to lie, are you?
maybe i can help?
call what off?
what's that noise?
look, i'm horny. keep it in mind.  love me a little?
you can't kill me yet.
what do you do over at your bank, grant?
it was my ass that almost got trashed!
all them miners last century. hungry ghosts, killed off all the indians. up at the mine. earth ran red with blood, think i'm fooling around here. white sky was on fire. grown men cried like babies. i saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. they put me in the joint. took my eyes. i cursed them. white people can't seem to stay away from indians . you gotta watch where ya put your fingers. pussy pussy pussy, indian pussy.
why's that?
well, shit.  could be worse.  i mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
... no, i went in for more improving pastimes.  philosophy classes, language courses, european history, all that lark. did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
i want to ride my own bike.
so then you just call him.
ever pick your feet in poughkeepsie?
you are young, inexperienced.  you do not know what time can do.  how it can sap all pity, all love.
this thing was the size of my fist, peter!! that's off the charts!
-- way we could safely --
yeah?
hey butt-head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
this is zero cool, man! whooo, haha!
certainly, sir. how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
five hundred.
... as they head up for the show. oh yes, well i mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
we should go! we should go right now!
oh, i-i left it at your house.
jackson, how many times i got to tell you, you're from tennessee.
what?
...yeah, go ahead.
shhh!
what gives, don corleone?
tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  je l'ai choisi moi-même.  tiens.
i'm the best.
not at all.  and eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. my first.
i'm sure it is, frank: and let me tell you something. if we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  see my point? let's talk a minute. frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
ed, what was the one thing i asked you to do?  make it <u>seven reels long</u>. i've got contracts with my exhibitors.  if it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
apparently it's huge.
what?
"and" what?
i just put them to bed. can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
don't think i can't persuade her.
oh, yes.  i know about mr. rawlston.
it's one way.
sure.
love was never our problem.
hello.  is this jim garrison's daughter?
not a word.  but no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  and so i place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  you work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
i'm working on it.
you want to bet?
you'd never been out of new york?
maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
contracts? -- yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
neighborhood watch? is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
my script?
rich. young. beautiful. you must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
when one sees you they all see you.
i have plans nigel. you could come with me... i'm going places.
no lisa anderson, detective.
your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? you're the only one keeping that alive. for everyone else it's ancient history.
it seems that the english care more about you than the french.
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
i get my hostage first.  no one's turned loose until i say so.
wasn't a book...was a short story.
well, i mean, you don't have to, you know.
and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
during the day? we'll go for a drive or something.
whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
objection, we've...
your compassion is overwhelming, doctor.
no. no one that i know of.
not a lick. i look at a piano and i see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. beethoven, mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. they saw a piano and they could play. i couldn't paint you a picture, i probably can't hit the ball out of fenway park and i can't play the piano--
nietzche...
paul! paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. then he sees their friends odette and her husband jean baptiste.
why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
do you believe me?
and then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
i'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
let's wait for some slow one.
he'll take one.
everybody needs a hobby.  you explain it, vicki.  he walks out on his own party.  half an hour later, who turns up?  batman.  sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  no place to change.
oh, yeah...
that's good. it's not better. where?
you need to lighten up.
maybe he's wet?
why not?
i would think so.
no.
cecile, you have to tell me.
when i'm certain, i'll let you know...
what's happening?
as long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
i'm sorry, i usually would call rajeev, but i didn't know what to do so i called mr. bianchinni.
is she?
i'm sorry.  if there was any other-
hey look at this, no feet!
the grammar?
how does that happen? you don't look japanese.
you know, i had an apartment about this size once.
he don't look wise.
nice to meet you, fergus.
there. now you've got your profit and more. you'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
let me get this straight...
here.
you sure?
we don't want to go there.
i've been doing that a lot lately.
i was here six years.  and i only hated two.
did you tell them that i flooded the school?
thanks.
he is in his pigeon cage.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
are you okay?  you just face planted!
it was racially motivated. he's chinese. he was. and... i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that. don't they?
maybe we oughta find another place.
why am i here? what happened?
this will get me a second term.  damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. there's no history.  i, nixon, was born to do this.
no, no, that would be crazy --
right on the button.
i'll stick it in the evidence locker...
hi.
what's wrong with you!?!
haka xuki.
i want that fucking radio!
making sure nobody's following us.
a four hundred dollar lunch tab!
excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
why?  well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  i know i don't know you all that well, but--
okay. see you later.
back - back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. one minute. i asked you?! when the fuck did i ever ask you if i could come out here?! get this through your head, you -
if we decided on making him a new york type, could you do that?
what am i supposed to do?
alright, suit yourself.
when we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. the mountains have the highest concentrations. once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
is this your shovel?
i met you at my father’s funeral.
i passed out, but i'm okay.
have you seen what's happening out there?  the terror, the despair? the world is on fire, ellie.  people need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
yeah?
yeah, how did you know?
this is muley graves.  you remember the preacher, don't you?
i have to say you look terrible. what's the trouble?
i don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
i need a ruling on the hats.  i say a leopard-skin, and...
so tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  what really happened on the german front?  you know the senate's arguing your case...
here's your lunch. and an apple and banana for extra energy.
it's wood.  ed wood.
i love you.
sure. got a sixteen-year-old girl.
you want something?
darker.  more...evil?
so you're telling me you were set up ? i knew something was wrong.
who?
i saw una o'conner a few weeks ago. she said you'd been under the weather.
how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
i got time, bert.
getting there.
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor, jack.  like a true prince... a champion!
oui. nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
thanks, joe.
i just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  did you see his butt?  darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  you could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
no one's ever asked me that before.
fixing it.
what do you tell nicolet?
indeterminate life signs.
say, if you're stringin' me, old-timer ...
do you have any particular choice of girl?
i'll take that as a compliment.  in the city, what kind of place do you live in?
"my type"? what is this bullshit? how would you know what "my type" is?
and you chased one?
we'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, mamasita.
no one ever thought so. you must bring it out.
how the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  you take my point?
we are so alike, xavier. still, sometimes i wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
the names are merwyn d. mayor, who is the mayor's brother-in-law --
no.  it wasn't like that!
sophie... is walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, i'll tell you. wait in the office for two hours. if you don't hear from me, you and duffy meet me at 1712 alameda.
have the servants made you comfortable?
man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
what rank?  i believe corporal hicks has authority here.
yes. we had a glorious night together. one day you'll remember and write about it.
ellie--
kill him.
you what...?  is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  ah, christ. <u>marty</u>...are we <u>paying</u> you?
no.  i'm an archaeologist.
dr. zira, i'd like to kiss you good-bye.
...i thought you said you were a writer.
and centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  our adaptation was too successful.  we survived... we endured... for this.
why would i lie?
ever seen anything like that before?
what the fuck is wrong with you?  what burnt you out?
rick.  let me tell you.  wait, we're in the...
i was going to tell you. but then we were getting along so well, i didn't want to mess it up.
will it melt in there?
how?
... oh.  ... my god, i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers... anyway, the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, i felt. he's due here soon, i believe.
what's okay?
i'll go check on brenda.
don't be so bloody naïve.  you know there's a war breaking out.  this arrived this morning.  by order of the british government - all international expeditions to be aborted by may 1939.
<u>you</u> were the dirty cop... and i was on to you.  you panicked.  afraid i was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
you're a day late.  we keep a schedule aboard ship.  lives depend on it.  hello, philip.
the were burning their fingertips with lye.  the stink was unbelievable.
y-yes, jim.
check target approach.
oh, i was going to discover the secret of the universe.  that's why i liked nix.  he promised me all these explanations.
thank you.
about what?
he never would have believed a woman like you existed.
yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
i got somebody you could run over, mother!
aren't you going to get that?
it is to me too.
you start.
because i have to!
a lot's happened since we last saw each other.
a restaurant.  in piazza navona.
is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
killing himself.
what'd you do?
i... i like you.  a lot.
that's right.
do you know him, mrs. vo -- mrs. lampert? leopold w. gideon?
no inner feeling.
we're on vapor, cougar, you got to put it down.
that's what he said.
you're nuts.
maybe they're not tricks.
you want the rest of those numbers, mr. dickson?
it's a real paris reunion.
no, just do it real quick.  i'll meet you down there.
a change of plans?
i guess mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
can!
i take out the garbage, because...i'm glad we got that straightened out....
but listen, if i had a friend in the same position, i would tell her to delay a year.
aces full.
i do not!
where did you get this?
baron couer de noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  we dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
i have several jobs.
you're hurt --
sure.  i'll call the guy.
mmmm.
you're already contaminated.  it's why you couldn't hear the tape.  there's probably a pentacle near your bed.  to sanctify you.
what are my choices?
my insurance does not cover pms
hey, just cancel that shit right now! you're hurt. you're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
you're upset, huh?
good.
shut up, sir ! we need pick up now !
what is it?
gary knows i'm close on skywire. we have to do this fast.
jesus.  what is this?
i'm forty-six. do you like to go up or down?
cowards!  twenty run from four?!
stretch it out.
thanks, billy.
cooch.  where the fuck did they send us?
that's right.  they treat you like scum i bet?
also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian.
how much time do you have left on it?
does it bother you? what he said?
i know -- i know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- i know he is ill.
i don't know.
taken.
jon -- i don't have time to play games.  there're leftovers in the fridge.
maybe i'm not a good man. maybe inside i'm bad, and i'll always be bad.
who's on television?
what is it?
what do you mean?
toss 'im overboard!
who are you?
hi, baby.
no.
what plan?
i made only the first two.  the others were done by hacks.
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
was it -- swine?
no.
we could still talk, you know? it's nice to talk.
-- we call them "vactors".
i just had breakfast with her. she didn't say a word about this.
okay honey.
and what is your present salary?
you want to show this?
move away.
uh huh ...
well, yes.  i suppose i am a bit anxious.
for the last time -- surrender!
yeah?
no!  wait...um...  we're the a-squad from lincoln high? so, uh...
good. makin' steaks for supper. i expect you to come.
ben, come in.
well, i don't.
hi!
what did you say?
ha ha.  that's very funny, buzz.  this is serious!!
sue, i need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. at best, let's say i've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. to so many things i want to be for bill... funny business, a woman's career. the things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. you forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. that's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. without that, you're not woman. you're something with a french provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. the end.
disappoint me? why, what do you mean, dear?
well then check back tomorrow.
four passenger, single engine cessna.
duggar called him?
what?
now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. the more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
oh, about ten days ago.
freud, do you know...?  freud psychoanalyzed patients in one afternoon.
did i miss anything?
he doesn't gamble.
oh, please, nick.
what!?
may i suggest that you call the professor?
gary blinker's fulla shit!
well, that's to be expected.  they have to understand.  these are start-up problems. this isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  i'll write them a letter.
me, i'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- montana, colorado, idaho. but did he ever think to organize the women? no. wives don't count in the anglo locals either.
no, your kids.
the organization wants to make a change...now that nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
we got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
no, i want you in.  but being in means you gotta do something.  not just say you're in.
yeah.  if.  whatever.  what kind you figure it is?
yeah. how'd you know?
is it a secret what you're doing here?
i teach this shit, i didn't say i knew how to do it.
here ya are.  keep the change.
you've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. it'll all change.
you want to hear this idea? it's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. go on, tell her.
merrick...
a blister shore can hurt.
"little latin lupe lu."
leave it on! now we are going to do this thing. we are going to have a conversation. think of another topic.
how much money have you got?
i thought i made myself perfectly clear.  you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it.
used to be a meat-packing plant. slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
i suppose you want to know where i'm going to kill tonight, peter?
what?
no time for that. i'll take care of them.
you come way out here to get into more trouble.  you could've stayed at home.
i knew i could rely on you.
man live by his rep.
what?
me?
the other one?
whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  you were her doctor.
i don't know. maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
steve, dear, please forget all of this.  what can it matter after tomorrow?
"nor did they handle axe or knife to take away their victim's life -- no sooner done than in a chest they crammed their lately welcome guest."
wait! you can't kill me. mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
that's what i'm here for.
maxie's fucking with me. he put you with the spook to get under my skin.
we’re almost done here...
they don't.  they're always asking about you.
maybe he's just - waiting...
...policemen. i have to call them sheriffs.
i don't... i don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
doctor gynde, my whole family's sick. what's going on?
no.
lois, what are you doing?
since you were a child?
well, harry york is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. why do you ask?
all right, ace?
you still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
was she there?
fine -- terrible.
l.a. is in a constant state of warfare. gangs fighting for the right to rule.
so could i. and i'm a poor businessman.
silly?   silly am i?
trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
of course, they have the same chance. they can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
when he was seventeen.
how come it feels the same?
what?
forever.
i'm a simple man. i'm just doing my job. i <u>enjoy</u> my job. why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
jus' take it slow, buddy.
oh.
well, i won't be around forever, you know?
and what did you do tonight, honey?
so?
he knows what he's doing.  he's worn before... a lot.
so, viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
about me? how sweet.
are you dr. louis judd?
i've never seen anything like him!
old habits die hard. are you alright?
you looked right at her, baby.
i might make him nervous.
i didn't realize you were so sensitive to bob's feelings. considering i did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
fuck you! if i'm gonna kill myself i'll do it when i'm good and ready! you can go to hell!
--jeeeeeeesus--
start over.
they got us sealed. what are we gonna do?
do you know where you're going?
... is over.
eventually.  does it have to be right now?
i believe he is unwell, ma'am.
because she's my...my...
i know you.
no, that's not what i'm thinking.
it wasn't so important to me. i mean, he never asked me why i was a hooker, and that was impressive. i really liked him. so i decided to just play my part. i mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. i suddenly came to a decision.
hey.  this is looking good!  paul, where's the octopus motor?
jesus, i gotta save all your asses. i help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
what?
hey, if you live another week i'll be impressed.
epidural hematoma?
478...
thank you.
how much did you pay?
this is the one that looked at dana.
no, this has been going on for some time. several months. about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. they were from people who were reported missing. they never found one complete body, only parts.
yeah –– old joe college wainwright, they call me. well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
the fuck you talking about?
oh.
wait. please sit down, mr. gittes. we're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. as you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. the city comes first, naturally.  but, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
wake up.  make a right at ocean avenue.  the hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
i'm going out for awhile.
well, your prediction was on the nose.
yeah. i think so. it's hard to --
time out....jason dean. your pop's fred dean construction. must be rough. moving place to place.
i'm quitting, frank. as of midnight tonight.
kip… i -
how do you like my dress?
i thought it was great, i thought you and big john would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  instead it was --
commander powell, this is doolittle. ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and i have to ask you something.
really.
how about this one?
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de bretagne... 
she's not in a bad mood. she's like that all the time.  it doesn't bother me anymore. it's my dad and my brother i worry about.
oh come on, verbal. who do you think you're talking to? you really expect me to believe he retired? for a woman? bullshit. he was using her.
you're right. you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner. since you two are partners and all. it might be a nice gesture.
...education, were you?
nope - just came by to chat
"fifteen minutes of fame?" i'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
shelly, do you think i'm pretty?
it's alright.  i can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  what is this place?
how was your day, today, sir?
i told you.
right. get back to me on that one. once your plan is worth a shit.
i know you need one when it's really cold.
well, i'm afraid i do.  there's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  he represents my investors.  he says they insist on outside opinions.
he doesn't scare me. i'll kick his ass in.
my father has a gun at home.
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and buddy get half of whatever we take from ripley, understand?  how you and glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
well i have to come up with – an outline, i'd guess you call it. the story. the whole goddamn story. soup to nuts. three acts. the whole goddamn-
what a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  it was my understanding we left all that behind.  but, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
shut up. i like the kid.  remember the night he took farella at st. nick's, charley. we won a bundle. real tough. a big try.
mornin', doc...
wait?
on the contrary.  it has everything to do with the world.  and our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  you enjoyed the girl?
... do you have a gun?
breaker. breaker.
that nobel prize will just have to wait.
and how do you feel when you are lied to?
well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
but the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
things are all leafy and suburban ...
i'm sorry --
how would you like a punch in the nose? stop treating me like a child.
just where you'd never think to look for him. we'll be there.
oh great!
visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the indianola savings and loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
i leave tomorrow.
"one falls, two shall arise." so: you pop one, two come out. you kill two, you get four. you kill four, you're in trouble. we have to nail 'em all at once. and the eggs.
not exactly a lightweight.
i already did.  i mean, i talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
can you hold it?
good morning, colonel.
how do you tell those two apart, anyway?
hello, mulvaney here...
beth --
so?
we've been talking it over, andy. your future that is... we feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
pardon?
i wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
sharp.
you're supposed to be my doctor, right?
what forces do you have at your disposal?
hello...? sully...?  sully, that you?
excuse me–
there was nobody on the bridge.
did you hear that?
two or three years ago i would have stayed.  and fucked you.
no, you don't. you've always been strong.
i don't know.
i missed you, fran.
maybe you don't know. i know you though. you're jeffrey beaumont and i know where you live and i know ways to get you and i know ways to kill you.
for the best little computer officer on the mercury mission.
what did you say she was getting?
got it.
sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
who cares what he spells it? read the letter.
here's my passport.... please give me a visa. i have to leave for russia immediately.
we'd be in the hole by now. hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  or should we just turn on the shower?
what do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. he feels no pain. he can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
there is only three of us here.
still playing by the rules.  you're a damn good kiler.
sing it to me, frankie!
yeah, well, she's our girl now.  i think we better keep an eye on her.  there's trouble there.  hey, listen to this.  ethel and bert lane. married seventy-five years.  you believe that?
quinn will be here any minute.  what are you going to say?
there's a lisa shermer living just sixty miles west of here. over the indiana border. i'm going.
jesus. listen, jill, tell you what. tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, i'll drive you down. i'll get off work or something.
that's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
no, the other hotel paraiso, in the city.  near the plaza del sol.
it's the news, buffy.
maybe...  sure. yeah. as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration. but so far, we haven't found any other photos.
a girl.
oh, bill... main justice is investigating a major new york bank. laundering narco dollars out of their mexico city branch. you want it for the evening news?
son-of-a-bitch...  mr. maroon, i think i'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
i don't know, okay?  all i know is butch cassidy's back in town.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. she was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... it's always like this. it's always a fucking waiting game. i've been through it too many times already.
no, we don't!  you're full of shit! you say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  my brother died over there last november.  why?  what good was his death?
early night for you, isn't it?
active matrix, man. a million psychedelic colors. man, baby, sweet, ooo!
have fun tonight?
i needed to know.
i'm sure.  and kate, thank you for coming.  thank you for being such a good friend.
what did you find? what did you see?
well, that defies the point, don't it?
one day they'll find a cure for aids. they'll never find one for sex. it's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
what for?
we'll check it out.
people make mistakes.
so waddaya feel like doing tonight?
it is sacrilege!
you're worth every last penny.
that music is for everyone, mister mcmurphy.
where's the keymaster?
bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
it was wonderful.
departing dark side, regula.
no -- letters to two-eighty.
nice.
i've had this feeling -- ever since i've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that i have to be rude all the time. do you know what i mean?
works for me.
 move.  this is already affecting our schedule.
i don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  not while i'm holding this.
yeah, but –
now that is very interesting --  take a chair, joseph,
raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. otherwise this is just another story --
what!?
this is nainsukh -- from the village. they bring him here to dig in the mines.
yeah. when you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, joan crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. not even in "mildred pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
when? now? oh. no.
huh?
it's all right.
hey! -
headache, huh? too much sun, i guess. you want to come in?  still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
i told you, i quit.
oh, he ain't nobody.
that's the point, you stupid fuck. let them buy it.  we let them buy the case.  that's what i took it for.  you let this drop -- we'll go up to new hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
you can't go now.
why did you move the body, doctor?
oh, paul. i'm dying. does she wind up with ian or windthorne? you have to tell me.
poor guy.
well, what do you think?
so, you surviving without me?
i came down at the queen's request. i'll take my orders from her.
that money's not ours, adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
you have a red shirt.
i wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
this kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. what have you got?
it be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
not anymore you don't. it's obvious.
you're kidding? what did they say?
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
lois, i usually do.
george! he's supposed to ask you to the dance!
this isn't just a story!!  it's history made allegory.  it is a philosophical handbook for life!  it holds the secret of this very voyage.
what about the other two?
i don't know.
what?
and if they succeed, humans won't make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow.  as first officer i should be the one beaming down...
i know what everyone knows. try like hell for renewal. you have the same chance everyone else has.
no.
my sister's youngest, admiral. crazy to get to space.
let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
you dog!
go to him.  go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, esselin retreat, nudist camp --
loretta...
everything depends on the manchester merger.
i'll bet you can.
you've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... margo, tell me what's behind all this.
well, you see, i've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. so we were going to wait till she went to europe.
i only lit it because it was so cold in here. i'm sorry if...
other ships, yes. but no experienced commanders. captain, i need jim kirk.
look, sister', manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. i ain't never been off it. i know it like you know your own back yard. you get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and i'll get your sister for you. i guarantee
after breakfast, mister mcmurphy, after breakfast.
no class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
i started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  a blond.  i only caught a glimpse. she was young.  i should have said something right away. but i didn't.
she must have gone out for a walk with the children.
cause i can get a job.  i will.  and you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  would that make you happy?
you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand, ernest. did i miss something?
you know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, stanley....  i'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if i don't, i come home without the money....
i told you the questions might get a little personal --
cool it. we got business.
want to say goodbye to the colonel?
baghdad.
hello, louis.
yes?
ready?
you know, i've been living here for almost three years. now in three days it seems as if i know everybody. when i pass people on the street i want to stop and say, "listen, i got a fella."
hamlet.  what's david berkowitz got to do with sid 6.7?
i haven't been to the movies in ages.
reverend mother -- thank-you.
twenty-one.  the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  the horror pictures were trifles.  grand guignol for the masses.
don't take no tone of voice with me, homes.
great.
grow up, johnny. you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
yeah, we're closed. so go away.
jeanne, i beg of you... sign!  in god's name, don't you understand? i'm trying to save you!  if you don't sign, the english will burn you to death!  is that what you want??
good. gibby gave me champagne.
and live on your salary, i suppose?
rules are rules, mr. lombardo.
what're you gonna do with me gone?  you'll drive your wife and kid nuts! i bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. what's her name, janie?
minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. the instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. the cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. the carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. you cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  i will leave him on this side.  then we trade places.  you get him, i get her.  get the picture, lois?
i assigned you bingham and washington to go along.
poison gas. invisible. don't forget.
oh, i am thinking of the o'higgins of redmondstown.  general o'higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, colonel granby somerset.
don't you believe it, rose. don't!
you're gone now!  i don't climb with people i can't trust.  why'd you come up, to prove something?
it would ruin us, buddy, our family.
what are we downloading?
don't say that!
he comes up here with our product. he suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. he never shows up. meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. me, i just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
i talked to johnnie white at the bar association.  the broad used to work for one of concannon's partners in new york awhile ago.  she wanted to move to boston.  how badly did she hurt us, joe?
what's that?
much better this morning, thank you.
how do you figure?
what door am i at?
...on ice!  we've got elvis on ice!
can't we do it on the phone?
she was afraid.
uh huh.
i won't be able to stand.
you son-of-a-bitch!
this is stupid.  it's going on a month now.  how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards?  they can bomb them all they want, saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. what the hell is the army waiting for?
nothing personal.
he wants me to testify?  is that what he's asking me to do?
professor? professor brown?
he has been imprisoned, here in the potala, holiness.
like what?
you like mysteries that much?
whatcha looking at?
oh, yes. i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl. i used to love to go fishing with my father. that's funny. he was a lot like you, my father was. talked like you, too. sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. and after awhile, for no reason, i'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. he never said very much but once i remember him saying: "no matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
he saw the accident...?
that's right, you've had to supervise yourself. this place needs a sales manager. somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. he'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. what do you think?
i'll tell you what i do think.  if they say they're for disarmament, i say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
i found these. the others are still in storage.
hello?
yeah.
what i mean, when i say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. it is vulnerable and endearing. and that is annoying as shit.
and like she said, do it before the parade.
well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her daddy.
they're not supposed to be here!
he wants to show now.
four grand. for the hospital. is that enough?
funny, i've never been a talker. my wife was always getting on me about that.  'say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  i never would though.  not really.
is mr helpmann here?
no doubt, sir. but i am endowed with talent, and you with money. if i offer mine, you should offer yours.
free?
ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
why the hell would i--
really?
yes, yes.  it's just that john is so much nicer. jack sounds so ... crude. when i was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named jack. i guess i just can't help making the association.
fantastic! what talent.
why do you think she ran?
i don't know what you're talking about. i just wanna see ganz nailed.
suppose i meet you there a half hour before.
put it on the bed. that's the way it's done, isn't it?
fuck you. ok, so tommy's got the virus. bad news, big deal. the gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? swanney fucks his leg up. well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
same one you were reading the other night?
whatís hunt doing on the tgv?
it wasn't what i wanted.
i'm not finished. i'll only be in port one week a month and when i'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who i am. like i told you on the phone, you i'd be better off in that state school back in virginia.
right, that synchronizes here. okay, bomb, arm yourself.
i'm trying not to.  i just wanna know what's gonna happen.
go to your room.  and you...i don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
eddie... it's one thing to compare clyde gruner to jesus christ. it's even okay to claim that shu kai kim is just slightly holier than the pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
and you must be steed. please don't get up.
is that what makes a winner?
why... 
thank you, quince.
how'd you like a little payback? not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  did you know loew was a swish?
"half?"  what did you, take a nap in math class?  three people, three shares, one third.  four point six six six repeating.
hello, major, my name is dymshitz. i'm glad to see you.
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
that's not why we're here.
i can just barely see him.  i think he's leaving.
you don't have to explain.
never know down there.  helps to have a friend, sometimes.
-- where? -
look -- you know who that is, captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
whichever you prefer.
so you tap everyone's phone? you use computers to probe financial records? new search and seizure laws?
let's go by rosarita's. you been there yet?
it means she's insecure.
-- institution.
ever been tempted?
beg pardon?
never mind.  i'm tired.  i'm going to take a nap.
except yours-yours.  the goal of world domination.  well, if you put it that way, minnie.  how can i resist?
no doctor!
yaa, i'm a dead poet!
you work too hard, pop.
they nailed the windows.  i can't get'm open.
dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
lovely sound- they seem happy.
it's been a good two years, victor... the company's accomplished so much.
i'm married.
i'm sorry for the screw-up. but i couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. i couldn't help it i had to stop at penny's for the costume. and you were hungry, remember.
bainbridge books.
we're the shit.  bigtime.
yes, i'll accept the charges.
yeah, i guess.
no reason at all, darlin'.
i'll have it for mr harry in a few days. i have been busy, and i am nearly there.
also, on a daily basis, i want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how i should live my life.
i'll hang on to these. we don't need them till we get to gollie«s. okay. any questions?
uh huh.
it's not about the money, x! you never plan for anything. i can't live like that anymore, i need some stability.
got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
my girlfriend.  if she still is...
where'd he go?  i'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
no.
quiet, mollie, quiet!
there has to be! i know it exists! it has to!!
there's been a lot of confusion in the media about who i am and what i'm up to and all that. i'd like to set the record straight. with your help.
—running around. not your work.  you'd better start reforming, cyril!
and that's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again. so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you've found is back again.
where do i go now?
in the still...still of the ni-ight...i held you...held you so ti-ight...
of course, one must admit he has great courage.
damn.  just when it was about to get interesting.
does it have to do with jamie?
let's not get into this again. i know him.  if you said something, he'd take it out on me.
move it, what are you waiting f...
i can't go home. after lewton's, they'll be after me.
you were singing, weren't you? a beautiful voice, miss st. aubyn.
i bet he don't. karl likes me.
stanley moss, ladeesngennlmen... and she says...
...i had a girlfriend... a long time ago.  before coming here, in my country. i was 14-year-old... we flirted like kids...  her father didn't want her to meet me.  my family was not very respectable.
...if they're wrong?!
get going where? i can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
she works part-time at my dad's store.
what cards?
nothing's happening.
i don't understand.  what does this have to do with...?  you carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at trader jon's...? come on, man. you're about as close to being officer material as me.
what?
it's the truth.
i told trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
i'm sorry, baby. what can i do'?
sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
yes!
could we go with you and film it?
you two faced bastard. i knew you were full of shit.
come again... ?
yeah ...
not me, idiot - him!
rest, highness.
okay, jack.  nice doing business with you... cash is about to take off...
was there anything in those offices that didn't go to d.c.?
i'm sorry...
...excuse me.  can you fix this?
i'm out.
easy there.
jill, you're a real sweetie pie. you really are.  you're sure you don't mind?
tanks...coming back. let's go.
what people?
he's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
what "magic" have you brought, erik?
maid's night off?
...yah -- 1963. her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in louisville, her hometown. those were different times.
i must receive proof more conclusive than mr. poe's opinion before i weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
do i look wasted -- asshole?
you're kidding.
it just proves that the difference we have are...
can't we just see the end?
stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. absolutely none.
you don't have to tell me jeff. we were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. the twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
okay, i'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?

you know, little sister, i never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. i knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
were you recently promoted?
and we moved out here for the quiet.
i can't do this alone. i'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. i need you to chaperon. separate everything but cars. you said you liked convertibles. now i'm on the hook.

exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... that's what the public expect from a carl denham picture! lead us into the mountains, sir!
i love you, margie.
i'm freezing
yes. yes, they were partners.

my dog... you know... i mean my little dog with the adorable face... don't you know what my dog looks like?
how'd you know 'broken mirrors?' bribe a cop?  tell it to the u.s. attorney, lounds!
is that agent desmond's vehicle?
is that why klute didn't tell me?

polo.
funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
they've turned off the ventilation system. they're calling him to dinner.
bud, i hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  darien...lightning has struck! the lightbulb has been invented. edison, da vinci, einstein are watching...
i'm twelve.
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
ha ha... yes. with prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... as we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
tom, you startled me! you're back.
he is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! he'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
i have no conviction, if that's what you mean. i blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy.
i've been calling you for five minutes! didn't you hear me?
all right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. okay? you happy? so now what?
no.  i admire you.  i...i fell in love with you the first time i saw you.  i did. i think that you are the most--
well, that was a very promising start. by my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. yes? dr. brodsky's pleased with you. now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
if we're going to virginia, why don't we drop by fort knox?  i can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the god damn cia.
i've never lied to him before.  it's the first time he's ever lied to me. he was just as convincing as when he says 'i love you.'
i saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
hey butt-head, i'm starting to feel weird. i think i'm freaking out.
i'm glad ya come.
oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
you got anything smaller?
i'm going to kill him.
yeah, but roselli wasn't just any gangster.  he was the gangster who set up track 2 in cuba.
where's my gun?
of course you should. c'mon, i'm already a million hours late.
should i... should i tell you why?
she's having an affair.
no. what you usually say, i guess.
there, like that.  kind of, uh, sexy.  you can support me anytime, john.
a good day for singing...
oh, please. i hope you're not going to run away this time.
bud parker and william johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of conduct and laws of common decency. do you admit that on the night of may 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall:  red, pink, vermillion, puce, chartreuse, umber, blue, aqua, ox blood, green, peach, crimson, yellow, olive and magenta.

you've made your point perfectly clear, mr. kane.  good day.
you knew the lieutenant before the war... what was he like ?
so, you just get here?
...but big.
who is he?
then will you teach me what i need to know.  maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
say, brad. i think he'll be better off doing it his way.
they won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
very impressive.
he kidnapped you, kathryn.  you saw him murder someone.  you knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  you were under tremendous emotional stress.
"a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st. louis, missouri. the brave and daring james-younger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west."
good god, the way you live here. this place hasn't been dusted since mother died. look at that goddamned refrigerator.
don't go.
the child is mine, uther. i have come for him.
yes, but i don't want to leave.  i think this guy's following me.
i saw my grandmother, of course, but i don't suppose that counts. i mean, she was alive at the time.
it's a guaranteed blockbuster!
relativity.  explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
what people?
i thought i was supposed to stay in my room.
screw you.
forget it!
you don't remember.
you were saying...
no.  they're beyond that!  they're smarter than the humans.  what's <u>more</u> advanced?
you wanted to get the truth.
that's right.  will break through.
i don't like what you're saying.
what do you want to do?
yes, and then, what was there to call about?  everything was up in the air.
wind's up. it's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
where's it coming from?
the partridge family?
how'd you know it was me?
yes. i'm afraid it does.
i've been to a few -- yes.
you would do that?
you equipped for random questions?
this is the first time i've seen him in years.  i didn't want him to think i was high-hatting him.
when i do sleep, i sweat a lot. usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming.
my parents are going to come home early tonight.
as it happens, i'm headed for frisco myself.
relax.  if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
i'll never marry you.
we must have a blow-out.
thanks.
well, i'll tell you why i ask. you see, i've got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, i'm a little concerned about her.
do you know her?
it's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
why are we landing?
she was your sister.
why not?
yes.  that's my case.  now it's yours. all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. decapitated.  brains extracted.  limbs torn to shreds.  it looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
what's so funny, cadet cowan?
i could subpoena him if i had a week.
it's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, enid.  i'd love to hear about what you're doing. i can't help but feel that i had some small part in how you turned out...  what are you studying? you were always such a smart little girl.
buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, i don't want to talk to you. i'm going out and sweep the patio.
they're real goddamn good. they'll be there for when ya need 'em. where are they?
dino velvet... yeah, he's like the john luc godard of s+m flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
this is the park view hotel. i'm the hotel manager. are you looking for someone?
i'm loathe to kill my brother officers, edmund.
my what?
i'll get the doctor.
i can't keep it to myself anymore--
this is your most lucky day.  my family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had.
uh,...apone, i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc, over.
mondays.
some say i am.  you want to hear what happened?
he seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
... 'cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. so then i wouldn't even try.
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan.
you look nice. i should have dressed.
of course!  the power is of another world.  another dimension.
so you knew this young man before?
tell me the settlement is right there! riddick, please!
really? no. not at all. you're a very pretty girl. you should know that. you should be confident.
if you'll follow me, professor --
yeah? but look at you.
yes i do. did you ever think that maybe i could help you? that maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
oh really?  where you from?
since how long?
i have to make him some chili. okay?
shouldn't we have invited tom over?
it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before... a far better resting place i go to than i have ever known...
but i don't remember.
comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
suppose i hadn't known that immigration inspector? hadn't put in a good word for you?
you have one of these?
yeah, i read the report...
who is it?
okay.
i'll have whatever she's having.
interesting approach. what was his name?
how?
we're going to europe next week.  i want to get passage booked on the queen.
hi lloyd.  i've been away.  now i'm back.
so...who's nicky?
doesn't look quite fair.
are you sure this is the river road?
so, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
well, i'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. when you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. some hard candy and some magazines. somethin' to keep you busy at night.
they knocked out the external feeds.
like a bet?
a beautiful geek? i don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
uh, better make it one.
don't you get it? i don't want to leave. this is who i am.
i'd like to do your hair sometime.
you never sang before?
what about it?
why, what's wrong?
but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
let us walk.  from what i understand, diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
play that sweet one you know. the one makes my wife here so friendly.
gee, your dad's smart.
no, that's my sister margaret's husband, frank. my sister margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister rose, she married a contractor. they moved to detroit last year. and my other sister frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in saint john's church on kingsbridge avenue. oh, that was a big affair. well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. how's that with you?
this is not the time for squabbling.
listen -- i don't even know your name.
hey, bo.
she's . . .
jeanne... we're not enough...
johnny? did you see ben?
sure.
it's all in lock boxes in a mexico bank. but he's got a problem. he's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
what the hell is that?
ha!
what does it look like?
you've absolutely no idea where david might be?
...i wouldn't lie to you, adele. . . i saw him kill that man.
which ear was it?
let me see what you get, but don't jump--the new york times thinks it's crazy cubans.
i love you, mama.  i love you, dad.
she'd punish me.
hey frank. you shouldn't be coming over here. my parents really don't want you to.
george --
original cindy, say hi to my good friend--
i'm late for surgery.
of course. as soon as possible.
i just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. we don't have much time until eighth period.  i have other things going on, too, you know.
frances farmer, contract player, six- month option.
she finds him.
don't feed that dog.
a gentleman would offer water.
well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
it's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
yep.
no, he just hung out there.
you asked my opinion, sir.
i'll drop the eighths.
yes, sir.
i'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
you were listening outside the parlor window.
i don't know, jack. he's got no face for me.
no.  his name is luca brasi.  you wouldn't like him.
you're absolutely right. and i had to come all the way to a pigeon house in shangri-la to find the only other person in the world who knew it. may i congratulate you?
no way. no fuckin' way.
take a vacation.  i'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
we are, miles. you know i'm right. there's something "off" about you and me miles. and maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. maybe...
it's obviously an aborticide.
...why on earth do the stones interest you?
no kidding.  he's a criminal.  i heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  he just got out of alcatraz...
yes! you shall. of course you shall --
no.  no, you go ahead.
walter!
everything is temporary. that don't excuse nothing.
pull them back!
excuse me, mister president, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
too far?
jesus, if i pick them up, will they stay in one piece? where did you get them from?
yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
oh....say something.
how so?
i had a visit from the british embassy. they think i'm a stray soccer hooligan.
same car.
...oh, bullshit!  he was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
going out on the 'aurora.'
sure.  they like to play.  we may see some today.
so, how do you know the owner, mr. bianchinni?
i'm gonna nail it.
what do you want for sam?
i can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  i owe viktor everything.
i might get a shot.
hey, ya like it? open it... yah -- the globe. pull at the equator there.
a convention? how'd you see her at a convention?
looking for something in particular? there's not much of a selection.
no more sitting in this room. i've let it go on long enough.
fuck semantics, doc! you saying its like part dejesus, part sixpack, part bowman?!
yeah.
<u>stensland and buzz meeks</u>.  two-man triggers knocking off mickey cohen lieutenants.  when they killed deuce perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
your name?
chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  but you can bring someone if you like.
okay.
well ... yes ...
three.  and add some basil.
i do care about you!
now you're seeing reason.
you should'a brought the girl.
i'm a real light sleeper, childs...
how you figure?
the room’s yours for 24 hours. it’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. you can do anything you like.
this isn't your responsibility. remember that.  don't let them use guilt as a tool.  if you want to stop, say so.
i'm not sure.  mr. schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  he says she's so famous now, maybe vegas will give odds on her.  i'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
i always liked him. especially last year in munich ...
. . . that was quick.
cindy, let me...
gee, we hate to leave you like this, major kong.  but there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
you're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
why don't you ask the mosebacke?     brazil. until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  today, they don't exist.
you liked the guy, though.
you saw wrong.
now use it.
*no*!
patkin was a tribute to baseball...
such a simple matter. this figure is the symbol of the palladists.
you liked my singing?
dinner's in the oven.
someone out there.
because my life is being ruined.
yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  he grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till i thought i wouldn't have any lips left.  and all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing i told you he called me.  then i ran out of the house.
i know that.  i know you would have done anything to find me.  i know you would have died for me.
steady on course. all systems normal.
who told you that?
it takes time --
as fucking if.
nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
we barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
you never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
how'd it go?
i just might.
what do you mean, old and ugly?
what choice do we have?
what the fuck -- ?
i haven't had much luck with women...
we're on to the game, ese. you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... it's all very cute. but come on, let's quit while you're ahead. i'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
let me tell you about hatchet harry. once there was this geezer called smithy robinson who worked for harry. it was rumoured that he was on the take. harry invited smithy round for an explanation. smithy didn't do a very good job. within a minute harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. he then proceeded to batter poor smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . hence, hatchet harry is a man you pay if you owe.
were you working here at about four o'clock?
that's okay. maybe it is. my mother always says -- "everything that's wrong with you is in your head." i suppose that's true.
been a lot of years, you know. a long time waiting. for what? end up feeling like a sap.
the odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
i hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
wait... just wait.
was his wife ever a suspect?
your dancing's very good.
do you have to be so damn forthright?
what is that?
mr. kross, i'm not here to sell you my stock.  on the contrary, i'm here to buy yours.
what is your full name?  your christian name?
good day.
it's a good quote, mary. i'm glad we both know it.
someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
claire is your wife?
you're kidding yourself.  an adult t-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  it acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  if people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
if he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
i guess it started back home. wisconsin, that is. there was just mum, and dad - and me. i was the only child, and i made believe a lot when i was a kid - i acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. but somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that i couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... i'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't i?
nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
i'm sorry.  perhaps some other time.
actually.  lower.  i am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  lower. the layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
when they...
see you? he can smell you from there.
it's a cover, then.  a cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  you work for the cia, it's the only possible answer.
i'm not sure. [beat] i don't really know.
what about it?
it hit me!  where are they?!
that's what i was sent down for. i'm your guardian angel.
hey, what's your problem?
yes, i did. it's terrifying! the police were at my house this morning.
they found the drop car up on mulholland.  i want you two to go work it.
&lt;&lt;no, no, no. i need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. i am going to be killed. i have seen the devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
what?
oh yes.  nineteen...just.  i'm cold.
i was in the can, for chrissake.
i'll get the drinks, but not here. let's split. i can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
that's not why we're going out.
well... you're walking me home.  i... i guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
probably on his way back right now.
yeah, but you were good, you were really good. fucking bin-bag', i liked that. you were good. you explored your maleness to the full there.
what about drake, did he ever show up?
we are traveling to lhasa. may we...?
this is too painful to look at.
i will decide the conclusion.
this is crazy --
whadda i gotta do, joey? i knocked him down. what did i do wrong? i don't understand.
you said she was shallow. yeah, and a nouveau riche.
john ultramalensky, right?
how much do you usually get paid?
we know why john was tagged.
now, what does she have to do with all this?
alright. you know who i think really did it?
why are you trying to kill me?
warp two... three...
did you break a cup, jack?
for god's sake, benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
what do you mean?
never! i'll get to new york if i have to starve all the way.
how long have you known her?
of course, of course...
-- and take this with you.
i'm gonna quit.
you sure you passed on my message?
isn't that illegal?
mr. lombardo from packaging wants to meet on friday.
those ain't cops.
have a good time.
you're learning the hebrew really fast.
paper says there's ten grand each on you, chino and lulu.
i...i don't know...
she likes you.
oh good, there's nothing to eat.
you're discharged.
he'll kill you, lenny.
karen colcheck. from woodsboro.
yeah.
un-fucking-believable.  dick's out on a hot date, rob's boning marie lasalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
they loved you.  i told you they would love you and they did.
i don't know if you've seen it, but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek.
yes, betty?
no. i mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. he's a very hard worker. very honest. very caring. gentle. good father.
shouldn't you lie down?
i have no idea.  i've never heard of him.  but i'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
i seen the light. i figure somebody was home.
excuse me, gentlemen. right back. he approaches carnes cautiously.
she's getting undressed.
back is in new york.
and this?
the "odessa dunk"?
you look better than veronica lake.  now, <u>pierce patchett</u>.
about twenty minutes.
we've got to get him out of here.
that's it?
jack crawford sent a trainee to me?
i don't believe you have "things."
is alyssa home?
i'll do more than tell you. i'll show you, back at my place. if you'll just do me one little favor first.
no, i mean, what city, what state are you in?
we better call the doctor... listen. i'll say how it happened, part i saw.
the range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the p.o.e....to even consider it.
twelve pack?
they're carrying guns in town.
nothing i didn't think of you before.
will i see you again?
maybe once. i re-wrote it, anyway.
five bucks! you mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
how was the meeting?
jeanne... what are you doing?
what is it?  your legs?  hands?
baby duck?
i still think you're okay.
not really...
why?
they changed franklin's portrait.
it doesn't matter how much we're played with.  what matters is that we're here for andy when he needs us.  that's what we're made for. right? everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
wow
oh, she's coming, eh, ma?
i'm listening.
that's great! there's the address and message all in one word.
yes.
thanks coco. it'd be so embarrassing
how ya doin' dad?
what?!
then it sounds like i'm doing you a favor.
i'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
i got my partner in there!
i bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
i don't need kuato for that.
how can i convince you to stop?
i'd rather not talk about it. i'll tell you about it sometime.
weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
when i say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
why would his worry?  or my children's worry.  or anyone's worry.  help the sit...
is that what you do? draw pictures?
what'd he say?
yes, i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables. i'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
really?
...yeah. but two's enough not to look anxious...
hell-
that country shit all sounds the same to me.
where i come from. boston.
that's not playing by the rules.
no, we're from san diego. why?
sure. this girl said...
is it true?
how do you know?
ouch !!! goddammit that hurts !!!!
i had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
how are you doing, warren?
but with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
you will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
they wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. they wanted to know if you remembered anything.
at topspeed...and adjusting distance for degree of miniaturization --  the sub should get through the heart in fifty-seven seconds.
when?
they don't have your winning personality.
now wait a minute! i don't think you should open that door.
excuse me, may i please use your phone?
yes, sir. the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
where are you going?
i sure ain't his fairy godmother... now i'm looking for ganz...where is he?
who the fuck is this?
amnesia.
because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
to the asylum?
'yes' what?
we're going to die.
i'll go.
hey, what's up.
seymour! hello! what are you doing here?
don't take cold, jabez.  come -- it's warm in here.
lemme fix you a drink.
ernie goose?  cynthia?
over behind the church, you know where i mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
no violence, please.
harry?
not yet.
--i saw what i saw.
what team?
where'd you clip this?
fucking.  she says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
i'll find out, you know. perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. but in the end, i'll find out.
you really do hear a lot, don't you?
is this multiple choice?
what way might that be?
why'd you want to help us?
they're all the same.  "financial security is around the corner." "your friends love you."
it was substantial.
god, i can't do this.
i need to ask you a question.  what made you get in touch with joanne braslow?
in a harem.
no, it's a good thing. i like it. everything about you is great. i like how you don't shave your legs. women are so much sexier when they're natural.
okay.
ladies first.  i insist.
we've lost contact.
you're late, pierce. i know, but i can't fire you. i've got nobody to work sixteen xray with walls.
yes?
it's in the suburbs outside havana.
wooo.  jealously rearing its ugly head.
i'm sorry to say i know what you're saying.
how the fuck could he know?
i don't care, just get me there.
this is it, betty.  they'll find us again, fog or no fog.
what about the letter?
what are you doing?
no, i know, but i pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
hello!  do you speak english?  parla usted inglese?  i'll say it again. did i urinate on your rug?
i owe it to myself to go right to the edge, rob, and this group does exactly that.  over the edge, in fact.
for me...?
you will live.  survive.
what we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'kay!
alright, i'll stay. judge, i want to...
scared to make a mistake.  supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by god??
uncle, you mustn't think that i won't be sad to leave you.
fuck you.  fuck you, you get out.
a murder.
that i'm used to.
max cherry.
and some problems cannot be settled without one.
they'd never talk in front of me. they'd walk away up the beach. nervous about something.
you're okay, though, huh?
my mistake. i apologize.
i ride with you, indy?
what was inside?
you ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
listen to me very carefully. there are three ways of doing things around here. the right way, the wrong way, and the way i do it. you understand?
conscientious, determined, dogged.
i am... grateful for what you have given me. but i still do not wish to be assimilated.
i mean was there another- i thought i heard a voice.
hey, me. over here.
it might be paranoia, but i've never lost my keycard before.
i'm afraid major strasser would insist.
she's the one who controlled the horseman, isn't she, sir?  sir? 
your old sweetheart?
why should <u>you</u> care?
is that what you came here to say?
must feel better this side of the wall.
gin and tonic.  plymouth or boodles.
you don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
the united nations are still here.
what's she doing?
can you wake up loretta? i need to talk to her.
he made friends with a family called columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, caroline.
he's staying here?  bob barrenger is staying he...?
experience, viktor.  i've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  i'm worried about you, that's all.  this woman -- she controls your destiny.
yeah.
she sings? what does she sing?
because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
can we go yet?
i'll bear that in mind.
what?
what do you mean?
no, i can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. this is as private as we'll get.
goddamnit, harry.  this is our butts.  so your life is in the toilet.  so your wife is banging a used car salesman.  sure it's humiliating.  but be a man here--
you like chasing the dragon, walter?
but these, like, white supremacists trashed my office, last week.
mr. yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? it's our baltimore field office. they know you're here with me... do you understand?
i want you to come with me.
that's the hard part.
edie.
oh, god! give me the fuckin' name!
you... you selfish, selfish child. at least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
hickory!
you killed two men, ben harper.
jesus, i'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  he comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... could you prove it, edgar?
larry!  what are you doing here?  mom sent you.
excuse me?
there is something that i always wanted to know. tell me, how did those boys die?
on earth.
heck, yah. ya think, is dave open yet?
oh, you look so cute as little elvis.
where does he live?
sir, the gentleman does not understand english.  he would not in any case, take the stand.  he came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  he is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
perfect dozen.
jimmy took it. jack's out hunting with evan twombley.
nice bunch of guys.
all right, take it easy now, take it easy.
life is a bitch and then you marry one.
i'm wasting time.
well, mr. kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
i was thinkin' i could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
hey!
that's what i'm here to talk to your brother about.  what's with him, i got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
ripped? they look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  i tell you what -- i'll call the police -- and,	what can i say? -- if i'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, i really apologize.
don't you have a girlfriend?
kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
i'm a girl, i'm a girl, i'm a girl -
i'll talk to conrad myself.  i'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
no... i didn't.
yeah, so?
not really.
bruce is making the nine o'clock train. i told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
phoenix asteroids? never heard of 'em.
baby, you're money. you're the big winner.
how?
if you want to be found that way.
i've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
i need you.
bullshit.							*
i don't really remember that.
won him over just like that.
not really.  she was just one of those names you hear growing up. you know, so-and-so who lives in ireland.  i really don't think anyone knew about this place.
with respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? would we have radium and x-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
you hungry?
something's wrong here.
...what was that back there?
he got onto the pool deck with a gun. how did he get past her security carrying a
seven. wow! burn's wetware matches her software!
f-i-n-k. fink, barton. that must be you, huh?
look at the statues, they're thin.
we got different information.
it's a hotel.
i don't want to go.
i could go for a whopper.
i’ve got kids, i’m going home...
really?
oh, my poor stew!
...four years ago...
i'll see what i can do.  you know, lainey.  i don't believe you've ever once asked to meet simone.  don't you like her?
twelve are dead.
well dad, actually i thought i'd take the morning train on thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
when?
what?
in here.
where am i? and how can i leave?
just the obvious stuff.
he's still got a good grip.  we need to dig more.
hi.  up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  we're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
i don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  wes!?  we'll send the gold up, then me and jaeger'll climb back.
make it snappy, colonel.
uh...
hiya, mr. corleone, i'm sam roth. welcome to the capri; my brother's upstairs.  you wanta take a rest before you see him, or can i get you something, anything at all?
strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
lay off of that stuff, son. it upsets your mother.
would you look at that?
well...
what are you doing?
do you mind if i drop off somewhere on the way? i've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
why, may one ask?
pelting down out there.
quiet!  callate!  where's diego?
huh?  no, really, i don't even have the bruise any more, i--
ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. it's what allows our children to sleep at night.
ok.  ok.
material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  i've been working on a formula for this.
did he say what they're asking him about?
why are you doing this?
darling, dr. fell.  my wife madame pazzi.
did to.
now where were we?
nah...  with you, i mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
god i hope so. hey can i call you later? peter's still here. he's in the shower.
as you were. lieutenant...?
sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
you don't understand!  the octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
but if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no jody.
just shut up, evan. you're wasting your breath.
tell them to come on in.
yeah i know.  patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  he doesn't want any attention.
okay, i'm on it.  hey.
to have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
well, uh, there's this benefit for rwanda we're gonna do. and, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where i get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
i doubt arnold will be afraid.
oh christ!  oh christ!
what's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
this boat's a mess.
there's coffee inside... i was just bringing this to tom.
i think you better put him on ice, man.
one for all -- all for one --
shit, shit, shit...
how potent?
what weapon?
the cubs. when they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
why? why? why? why add to your misery by confessing to murder? you didn't kill him.
you think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
ah ... sun tan lotion. any shops nearby?
then let me go. you don't need me.
like hell you do.
on the drunk.
hello?
or somebody else there is listening in --
what's gonna happen to me then? i mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. this is my home also. what suggestions have you, my pee and em, to make?
oh. have a good day at school.
intestate.  your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
you shouldn't use my name.
uh...
then again, why should she be? i mean with us, with our...
what's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
we coulda got two third-class!
where’s my car?!  where’s my ferrari!?
your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
i wonder if you could help me.
where are we now, commodus?  can you see the camp?  my gods!  the air is turning into ice!
sweet! oh, that is sweet!
they’d never let me go. and you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
look, maybe i'd better talk to dick. is he around?
think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's ford. how's that?
how long?
what's this?
what do you read?
how's miss jacqueline?
so cut both.
sir:
who?
no problem.
she's dead! i know what it is now when people say somebody died. i know what they mean! and i'm afraid. she's dead; she's dead!
you mean she just found out?
they was some cops here, ma. they was takin' down the license numbers. it looks like somebody knows sump'n.
yeah, man. let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
plenty of time.
catherine, you are very dear to me. we have cried many times together. when my husband died, i would have gone insane if it were not for you. i ask you to come to my house, because i can make you happy. please come to my house.
i already called for an ambulance.
what's the matter?  where's your husband, young lady—
pony? what's a "pony"? you mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? what's that guy's name? neil moynihan?
well, sure.
the captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
but without your brothers.  nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies.  you may explore the continent.
i see. then what brought you up here?
maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero stuff and join kiwanis or something.
me?
why are we leaving?
i've given them his profile.
it's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  they diagnosed jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. he has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
are you sure you can drive? you've really had a lot of alcohol.
i can't. i need my family around me now.
we're actually, finally doing this?
i’ve got work tonight, jane.
i know.  it's an awful lot.
"undermine?"
maybe. but, if i were gonna hack some heavy metal, i'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
i took your husband's buick...  i'll return it tomorrow.
what do you mean you're not a christian?  of course you're a christian, we're all christians...
i'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. so i'm going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition...
we're going up the tower, madeleine.
uh, oh...i see where this is going...
or believe, i'll bet.
are you alright?
i'm sorry, baby. i can't help it.
do you believe me?
ok.
...thanks natalie.
you said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
yeah.
are you ok?
you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  you could give me something.
i'm... i'm really proud of you, frances.
you know me home.  me name.
it's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  i had a father like that.
well...why did you put a knife in it?
i know who you are.  stand up so that we can talk properly.  you're embarrassing me.  i'm not that important.
i'm not a murderer, mr. mckenna.
in this hatchery? forty to fifty.
we were parceled out, all five of us. i went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. she was in charge.
anything...anything the godfather wishes.
yes.
five times.
of a fight he can't win out here.
not the focus.
lifted him from a carnival in belfast. held him hostage for three days.
you okay?
that's enough.
how do you really know there's gold in fort knox?  just because they say so?  we should go to tennessee and demand to see it.
if i may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
aw, what is this...
just half-a-cup of coffee. i never eat, darlin', you know that. not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. let's go, rose, you and brother, let's hit the road.
even when you say the things, there's always more things.
a champion of lost causes huh?
you cannot die.
anything harder?
trust me.  call that number.
thank you, sergeant major. thank the men.
something wrong?
rest, william.
what's landon carter up to?
why can't i go out there with you?
he's not a jedi, he's just a boy. obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
i am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what i've done!
my god... you're right.
captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
i remember every detail. the germans wore gray, you wore blue.
ray?... what time is it?
you lying son of a bitch...
you can stop. i will go on alone.
not bad. just regular.  you wrote me wonderful things, nick. personal things.
well, i certainly would have heard about that.
"boy stuff." that's the name of jeff's magazine. he prints it.  look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the state--a million of 'em. look, pop--let me read you a--
he did?
twelve years.
chalk up one for your side. now listen, you want to get to king westley, don't you?  all right, i'm here to help you. what i want is your story, exclusive. a day-to- day account. all about your mad flight to happiness. i need that story. just between you and me i've got to have it.
well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  they <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
italian.
mccay knows ?
not dope. something else. some what?.. he doesn't knob what they were buying. but not dope... people.
maiden name -- daniels.  you know her?
nope.
and what's that?
don't worry, it's totally understandable. most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
nobody dies in newport.  they couldn't even kill sunny von bulow there.  harriman drowned, but it wasn't in newport.
i'm not really dressed for a party.
the albacore club.
they only made a handful. we're lucky there's even one living in the area...
heh, heh, heh!  golly bob howdy --
now you talkin'.
oh, sure.
so, i come across the hospital convoy  i was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, mary, hana's friend, tells me about you and hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then i knew it must be you.
what's wrong? am i doing something wrong?
didn't hear it.
look, i'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. besides, i'm impulsive. it runs in the family. we're all crazy. mind if i smoke?  anyway, today was the 'bid day.' but as i was walking down the aisle, i realized this is total insanity. what am i going to do in texas the rest of my life? i can't marry jerry jeff. i mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. so, halfway down the aisle, i turned and split. you think i'm nuts, right?
how come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and michael fitzsimmons from dolores?
not in the least, madame. but you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
i got ways, lenny, i got ways.  okay, okay... i got a deal with some a the paramedics.  my guy pages me and i pick it up at the morgue.  so whaddya think?  this clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  right?
you want a war?
what?  president grant is...!
well, it's about how people have two personalities.  the side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
i specialize, roger...
mike's gotta go.  nice to meet you.
what... ?
you couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
no no. no. you don't understand. you can't make a deal with him. even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. he's a peculiar man. you could even say that he has principles. principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. he's not like you. he's not even like me.
i gotta get something, i gotta get ...shoes?  ties? hats...?  good.  good. 
god almighty. what did you do to me?
listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
you got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
my declaration of principles -  don't smile, brad -  take dictation, mr. bernstein -
well you're different, no arguing that.  but you're a lady all right. i'll take my oath on it.
you didn't see it...
i will.  when can i come visit?
then it's fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me. in the meantime, captain chekov, i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates.
is this what they always look like?
it's rude to talk about religion. you never know who you're going to offend.
come on, get with the facts.
do you want to know what happened with my parents?
good evening.
you okay?
rather astonishingly so, yes. and particularly so in the case of father perrault himself. do you know when he and the natives were finished building shangri-la, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
it's coming along.
at the frankenstein center.
when does the bus leave?
recognize him?
christ, what channel are we on?...
we won, austin.
--and we got a guy in justice--
i could hang myself.
i... i can't find my seatbelt.
take it,easy, boy...  seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but i'd say you knew exactly what you want.
how do i know you won't keep them all?
get some rest.  you're going to need it.
check.
i saved your life.
no. i cannot take orders from that underwear model. that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
i'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  can you remember the exact emotions when --
well, what did he say? i'm curious.
i'll take everything at face value. i'll be a good listener to you.
you're no match for scot, mr. romirez.  we're raised as riders.
there has been so much soul searching about this wigand, i've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
madox knows, i think.  he's tried to warn me.  he keeps talking about anna karenina.  i think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
how do you do.
if you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
no, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
i want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
uh-oh...
how about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? how good are the warrants?
uhura, hailing frequencies. right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
it's just the three cent.
you see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. what does that get us? a discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. now, i say . . .
according to the map, we're just about at school.
'cause you like their second one, you said, pop, girls. etc.  the one with cheryl ladd on the cover.  you didn't see the cover though.
which one?
... what do we do?
for some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. no matter. i had hoped to have the wedding next spring, lord turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. but fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
why, of course, hank -- i've always got time for a neighbor. what's on your mind?
see, it's all about what they see walking in.  a dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  random kill.  the kind you never solve.
you were not.
herman scobie. and you've never seen him before, either?
was there any trigger event?  a trauma, shock or...  you haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  the horror stuff?
but at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
after they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church, the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall.  everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  so they stuck it down here.
peter...
actually, i don't know...
just grin and bear it.
daddy, people expect me to be there!
what exactly are you doing?
i just paid out twenty. i'd like to get it back.
landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
no prints.
oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  so who's this guy?
why?
use it to meditate.  free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  do not waste it... for me.
...dad?
which way?  which way?
i just started it.
baby...
running time?
this isn't a death sentence.  greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  i'll garden.  i'll write.
oh, really?  i'm from playskool.
they wanted you to tell them what you know.
that is correct.
maybe myself.
a little late for that, scottie. he's asleep.  jack daniels?
just one moment, sir.
the hell i don't.
i'm not talking about does. i'm talking about hookers.
they're all the same.
of course he will. [beat] what day of the week is it?
is it your software?
well, i'll try but i don't know nothing 'bout nobody. i'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what i'm saying.
i thought i was foolish. i thought i'd mistaken infatuation for love. you said:
i don't want her spirit! i want her! and you murdered her!
i... i would take advantage of it.
jobs doing what?
agent lowry.
can i look at the pictures?
you the captain?
yeah, i saw all of erica last night, man.
i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
lindsey, lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
i can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation i'm in, i don't -- avi: you know what?  being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? now solomon, let me just ask you once: please. please. don't do this.
doesn't it ever bother you?
sounds like a french word, what is it?
those people are trying to kill us!
indefinitely?
too bad for meng, but it's not your fault, or li mu bai's.
not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  you need to get with the program.  seven minutes.  let's get out of here.
what?
well done.  brave girl.  you've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am i right?
well what do you think it is?
you could've handwritten it.
i see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
wish i could say the same.
without disrespect, look around you.  we overflow.  as do our courts.
oh...nothing.  thirty pounds.  i just haven't been very hungry.
what're you, crazy??
you serious?
bluh.
yeah.
a dick, man!  and let me tell you something: i dig your work. playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
how long was i out?
do i have to play with the little kids?
cindy, please! it's a matter of life and death. i'm asking you a friend.
fuck you.
you say you perform in the miami area?
poor little orphan, and her miss gulch troubles. gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
thank you. yeah, yeah, yeah.
questions? well, heck, i'll tell you anything you want to know.
lie down!
you're it.
you believe that?
stop it! listen to me. let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, ok? let's just review our options here.
use the thrusters and you'll be fine. we'll huddle together out there.
five thousand.  i kept half.
are you learning how to play it?
look, senator--i wasn't given a brain just to tell a boy ranger what time it is. what do you need me for? get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
it's not funny at all. one can't get intimate just off hand. i could go to england with you and everything like that -- supposing i met you next year and i said: 'how do you do, mr. preysing! and you said:  'that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester'.
we didn't see anything -  - did we?
you wouldn'ta jumped.
catch me at the vancouver royal if it's important.
you got the guts, tough guy?  gonna kill us all, is that it?
they work off the o2 tank just like the slice pack.
you think?
mara --
you've preserved my jag! smashing!
hi.
i don't know what you're talking about, man. i swear. this is some weird shit you're telling me... and i don't know how come you're doing it.
mom, i have a real job. i do good things for this community. i help people.
oh my god! i'm here with the...
oh my god.  this isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  it's a nightmare, i'm back at st. anne's!
what? now. st. peter's church, and peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
and will the dead ever return, freya?
be careful!
what?
back off, george.
kissinger?
agent chet wouldn't tell me what the blue rose meant.
if we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. you're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
yakuza.
hello?
"no fate."  no fate but what we make.  my father told her this... i mean i made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- never mind.  okay, the whole thing goes "the future is not set.  there is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
take the western passage.
who's she?
no not yet agnes, very soon but not yet. how did the baby get into you?
except this time, the mission is a man.
and more importantly --
first he's gonna shit. and then he's gonna kill us.
she told us about one.  the little sisters of the moonlight.  in las vegas.
heat, i think. the coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  through the roof.  but in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  i introduce you to myrna goldfarb. she's the best media consultant in the biz.
good night, doctor.
i don't know sometimes.
not bad...i shoulda warned you.  dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
i think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  i'm right.  only two hundred dollars.
that's your word?
i need sleep. some of us are mere mortals.
so what's in a name?  i wanna join him.  i don't see why we can't join him.
if they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
that depends on you. one woman only used three minutes. another filled up three two hour tapes.
of course i have suspected that our being here is no accident. furthermore, i have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. but that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. i'll meet that when it comes. what particularly interests me at present is, why was i brought here? what possible use can i be to an already thriving community?
why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, ray, an' let's go on out.
well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
you know, eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, i'd just be lost without you.
should there be?
a baby? what are we supposed to do with a baby?
uh, scooby, now i understand how you want to be a tv talk-show host and all, like conan o'brien, but did you know even he went to college?
i liked being with you last night.
not in love, exactly, but...
i was just tryin' to help him. it's not like i'm sleeping with the guy!
spaceship of some kind.
can i ask you somethin', lieutenant? how come you're doing this?  i mean, we're kinda curious.
i've got the conference next week.  i want you to feel safe.
we really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, bert?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
i don't have anyone else to give this to, somerset, you know that.  and nobody's going to swap with you.
uh, huh.
stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
i think you are.  i really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
i sure wish superman was around. he wouldn't let any of this go on. not for one minute.
go on.
you should have let me do the talking.
i can't just walk away!
judge man. watch yourself. sabu's got juice now.
hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
that's a lie. my family was here.
but the real story is how i got the car. you see...
do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the united states house of representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
babe brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
just one.  some lady called.  said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... but she still wants her occasional roommate. she'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
can you fix it?
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram?
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
you were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  but you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  saving yourself for the main event.  then i see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. carbohydrates for endurance.
listen to him.  "watch the suit," he says.  a little pisser i've known all my life.  hey, tommy, don't go get too big.
the workhouse.
i'm not.
...it's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
we can't accept it.  it's much too expensive. right, dear?
how'd you get her out of town?
dr. william e. b. dubois. 
what care the bones when the soul is free?
soda.  you got any soda?
claire...
how many sisters do you have?
i haven't any hard feelings.
sanchez...?
dr. cullers?
the bucks gonna stop right here.  if my son doesn't know the six new england states, if he has trouble with geography, i won't stick it in his face. i'll help the little guy. i'll put him in the car and take him out there. i'll take him to maine for a big lobster dinner, go skiing in vermont, hot dogs at yankee stadium...i won't stare him down.
no thank you, you crazy old woman.
we need ammo... go check his jacket, i'll cover you.
how are you doing?
oscar!  you poor kid!
i didn't know your family knew johnny fontane.
this is a real piece of shit.
you're just talking nonsense.
is there a press conference today?
me?!  no, uh, i'm just a transvestite.
i thought they locked you in your room.
i never used to think i'd do something like that, but now i'm not so sure. you ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
my oh my.
he didn't know you had been in a mental institution. be asked me if i knew. i said yes. i wanted to talk to him. he said he wanted to bring it up to you. face to face.
but i think it's time we stopped talking about me. a woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
are you sure?
the best.
this.  above all.
well? how do you like it?
it's a stunt. humans don't write.
hurry!
he remind you of that guy, tillman?
i see. and when was this unholy alliance joined?
oh yes.
may i help you?
yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
i'm going to go in.
why did guy beat you, jack?
a which?
where you goin'!?
read.
we'll exterminate the fuckers !
i just thought you should know.
are you sure?  jack -- this is not something you have to do.
dad's fishing trip, grandma's knee operation, grandma's birthday...
i quit.
beware the moon?
you see, i don't care if we are rich or poor -- i don't care if we're big or small, all i care about is jabez. he was the first man i loved. he never used to care about money -- we were poor as job's turkey, but none of us minded. now i've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. i've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. i've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. that's not like him, mr. webster -- it must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
why don't you go lie down?
eddie, are you okay?
of course. have you got a pen?
with all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
where is she? tell me!
what can i do for you?
it was one year ago...
what about it?
then you do think it was ambrose.
just a manner of speech, sir.
arline decision. supreme court.
i put you away --
it sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "hell."
mickey, mickey, listen, listen.
you know what, though? i feel like i'm really ready to do it. to have sex for the first time.
do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
he's not coming.  watch.  he's not coming.
and we didn't have to bring another present?
i love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. is that the way it's done in most houses?
this from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
so what do you got, a fuckin' hyundai engine under there? can i make it back to my house?
god -- could have killed me -- bad girl, nell!  how did you know to do that?
well i'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
i don't know the last time i've been out of the city... hey, my arms are tanning. i used to tan great. we gotta stop soon so'se i can check on spencer.
i wish my funbags would get bigger.
have you made any plans yet?  you know tomorrow is new year's eve.
i guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
vicky, wait.
man knows what he likes.
our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
are you dining on worms?
too bad we can't smell her.
you're hurting me.
let me talk to her again.
look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
you heard about that?
well--i--
i don't know about that i don't have any money i don't have any attorneys gus is my only real friend.
can't nobody read minds long distance. all he have to do is ask somebody.
--you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale--
no, that's... that's ok. we don't need any help. we'll be just fine. won't we, lynn?
a match made in heaven.
if reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
yes, matter of fact.  the wife's taking a nap and... i can never keep quiet enough for her... so i thought i'd look you up and... talk.
the girl was off today.  hey, i didn't expect you to sit up front.  so, your lady live out here?
he is to a lot of people.
it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. are you sure you don't want anything?
no mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, i got it under control.
i just upped my price
if we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the pacific for at least a year!
they said you're the one.
wait, this isn't the way.  who are you?
and you?
you like him.
they do consider this a violation of his probation. your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
but that's not true! i've got one.
saturday night then!  i'll take the train to new york and fly from there.
you must have missed your mark.
are you really going to kill them?
communicate?
you're angry--
where'd twombley get shot?
don't think about it.  it's over.
you expect me to pimp madeleine?
well, i live downtown.
it tastes bad.
what have you done?  did you...kill someone?
that's the whole works, right up to date.
richie!  she spent six months dating a criminal
it is.  it's what you hired us for. nobody touched your money.  nobody stole anything.  they're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
good liquor draws a good crowd.
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  that must have made you pretty angry?
thought you said this was a private club. how come i'm allowed in without bein' a member?
they said that? really?  oh, your parents. the nelson's. right, right. how midwest. i like that.
you need six.
is your niece older than 12?
why would i do that?						    *
you've got your mother, your kids--
:...finer spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black.
...i understand...
you've got nothin', bill.  i'm talking as a friend now.  you're riding on the titanic.  time to jump off before you get destroyed along with garrison.
what's that you're playing?
you could teach...you could....
yes sir.
what's it about?
no...you...go...ahead.
what?
i do, i have to be attractive to god.
i'm already dead.
told that's what our old man was. planned on going to sea, me and bob, 'til i read jack london. started trapping when i was ten. mailed the furs to sears.  eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  that was fine money.
john, i'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage, mrs. kendal. mrs. kendal, john merrick.
what are you trying to tell me? that you did it?
yeah, boss?
i did exactly what you told me. i went to		   * dodd and i said that i didn't have				* jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this teddy must have taken everything.
yeah, right.
why should it?
well... ok... here it is... uh... i'd like you to take a look at my horse. now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...

so what's the plan?
victor, i, i feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.

what about the killing and looting? that's just as crude, isn't it?
sure.
let me finish!
okay... but i want you to know one thing.  i've got to look great tonight, i mean i have to look great, okay?
i've had a long time to make enemies, dr. arroway.  there are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. and i will grant them their wish soon enough... but before i do, i wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom i've taken so much.
what for?
guess who i did it with last night...
he just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
i didn't say that.
oh, it's wonderful.
yes.
frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
there you go.  wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' bambi-lovers.
take a look.  i rearranged the numbers.  put 'em up to the light.  go ahead.  squint at it.
did you hear?  twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
it's a very good job--too good to pass up.  i'll be handling funding for the whole...  look, i...  ..."like" you a lot.  and you...  ..."like" me, okay?  maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
goodbye?
would you stay with me while i sleep a little?
thanks.
a warming wind.
i have a friend you might like to meet.

i'll come with you.
mrs. hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. you'll love my grandma rosa.
if we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  you know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?

who is he?
i was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
don't you want answers?
how's everything?
what are they doing?
this has got to stop!
what's going on?
you are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  he is a lucky man.
harry!

marlowe's touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations.
will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
i'm the man they're 	protecting. i'm the president. i'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.

it was beth's idea.
well, don't lose it. last time i gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
where is he now?
look, i loved "exposed!" and i hate it that you got busted. i know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not that bad.
i assumed because of the train.
i didn't ask him.  all i know is that i haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
yeah.
do you know what you’re doing?
mmm.
very nice. unless it caved in, too.
you and your husband have been kind to me, alura. i have something to tell you: i'm going away. soon.
charlie, it's just no go.  we can't agree anymore.  i wish you'd let me go to chicago.
since the last time we spoke? i don't know. could be better. could be worse.
more cough syrup?
that you guys shouldn't be here.
i did.  boy.
look, king, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
what... do you remember?
objection! these remarks are profane and irrelevant.

oh, go on.  have one.  fuck it.  you think you're going to live forever?
maureen.
what's that? only -- you're getting too near. i don't trust anybody.
merci.
yeah, okay.
and i miss you.
wait! before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that santa's compound is wired with the xp 2000 stereo type alarm system.
hey look, it's our teacher.
i thought of that.  then i said, come on, you're lombardo.  your reputation is getting trashed.  you want to stop the bleeding.  you don't want to sit in jail for three months.  unless...
i'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
you'll never make it.  you've out- smarted yourself.
that's not the point. we're just not in love anymore.
when? when are you going to do it?
he is the fifth leading authority in his field.
shall we go into the living room?
in there.
oh, yeah.
allowing max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
i have to be up early. 
watch it, heather. you could actually be digesting food.
you were the new and improved you.
is the day so young?
except you.
luck, jim.  don't forget.
hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  only way.
why'd you go into business with him?
it won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
it makes a whole lot more sense than collecting venuses.
is that when you split up?
those are cold.
now listen, it's hands off billy.  i mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
first i couldn't feel it, but now i feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
they knocked out my tooth!
just give me a receipt.  hey, sal, you okay?
the car accident? any of this ringing a bell?
i accept.
not what i meant; why <u>me</u>?
we can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
evening gown?
i'll give you back the 600.
his wife was killed yesterday.  she was with child.
uh - - about two million.
why?
i just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
it's a machine gun. this guy told me when i came to the big city i'd have to have a machine gun, so i bought one.  where do you get the money? to pay for all this? i mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
why?
you know how to use one of those?
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
i'm getting underway now. but you should know, i'm in alpha quadrant. the chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
how is she?
right.
we still talk, though.
do you love me, conner?
i'm through with you.
he doesn't deserve this!  you don't know him.  it isn't fair!
victor. i love you,
you could tell dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
i know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
he won't let us go. he's going to kill us.
with two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as i can. then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
we don't know, mary. we've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
oh really? thanks. i thought it was a sewing machine. what the hell is it doing here?
you wouldn't believe this, walter, but bruce holds the door open for me.
drink!
the penny saver sucks.
now...where were we?
i know, but i've been thinking --
i don't suppose i can go back to the university and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
pinta, do you have a pencil?
a thousand things.
how much longer is this gonna last?
why do you care about this kind of stuff?
oh, shut up.
falling.
in my bed.
she's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
the extraterrestrial now looks like this.
well... it's the men, sir.  they wonder how you know our position. we've lost sight from land days ago...
mind your language in front of my boy.
can you configure it?
reed. i was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, i walked.
"g.g. market one-eight-four-two."
here's something you might find interesting.  they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. however, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
you ever going to open those letters? miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
what did you give it to me for then?
what's that?
but they're using you!
from here i got access to every piece of data ever stored on dade murphy's parents. his parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. hmm.
it's a calder.
yes, thank you very much.
if i give myself up in exchange for sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
it's ten thirty in the morning.
did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
mr. president, let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh, who runs the center.
no you can't lose the shot.  the meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
you women are crazy!
they give you copies to burn.
don't forget anchovies. 
no.
but i understand what you don't like about me. i do. what i am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
just following your example.
oh, let me get out of your way then.
no, i was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. the whole thing was really... irrelevant. how do you like being married?
she okay?
hi, andy.  how's the weather up there?
what?
wait. wait a minute.
yield. i have the advantage.
all right...but keep your eye on me, boy...i'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...if you don't hear me first time i holler, you better read my mind...i don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
i was sure we'd met, weren't you, ted? this is herbert greenleaf's boy.
he bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
do you still feel suicidal?
it makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
he's broken his pattern.
oh, no, please, don't go out this way, mr. bailey.
shit.
how does that make you feel?
when is she supposed to return?
wait for gus to get here, sis.
tell me about von der null.
hmmm.
missed 'em dan.  you're aiming high!
this looks pretty good on me.
you don't know what it's like. herr mozart frightens me. he drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
luck.
what value is that? you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past.
i'll be home soon.
that's nice. what'd you tell him?
that's what the two policemen said, sir.
you talk to carl ?
l.a.p.d.
ok...good night mr. de santis!
oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
that's where she hanged herself.
sidney: i don't understand him.  we know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  to witness the act. we know he thinks the act is making him into something different. his 'becoming'... but i don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  the answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. that's what's missing for me.  why the mirrors?
oh. oh.
what did <u>you</u> do last night?  you look wasted.
ten.
i've never been on a plane before.
it must of been a convincing letter.
shuttle en route.
could've been a nurse?
she was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. how is that possible?
she'll forget about us eventually.
i came for grace.
seriously, though: we're going to eat, i said.
jeremy!  how fantastic.
but not over me?
easthampton hospital for women. excuse me, what is that, a joke? let me tell you something, doctor, those men at catherine laboure. men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. they were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
i'll get it.
hey boss, dekom trust is owned by pan illinois... which is majority controlled by lakeside dynamics... which is a division of windy city ventures... who's partners are...  alan seagrave, donald cosgrove, and jeffrey holcomb.
george, i hate sitcoms.
hey, guys...
didn't you get my message?
you're the key witness?
all right! listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when i tell you this but - you shouldn't do this..there is no holy grail.
i know i'd be a good father. i know you'd be a good mother.
what ... what ... ?
movie producer? yeah, why not.
you should read the book. i even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
all street mimes should be executed.
but what would happen to me?  i have no body to return to.
you got me out of my hotel room. you came and got me out of my room.
well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
she has no real grip on reality.
charley.
i just came back from phoenix.
that's not good enough. you've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
what?
good, 'cause i wanna swing by blockbuster and get us a video. i was thinkin' tom cruise in all the right moves. you know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
hello?
avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
they're smart.  been to college. they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
juliet who?
emergency transmitter?  all your gear is back at wilder's.
i forgot to tell you. yesterday i found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of o'neill's car.
you're serious?
listen to me. we got -- we got into bed with each other. but it was nothing. it was nothing at all. we might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. tell us the truth...is that the truth?
are they my kind louis? dolls never change either.
i asked you somethin', boy!
too far off. very near us. perhaps... underneath us...
good lord.  what do you study in history?
a lot of people are looking for you.
he tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." well, give me a fucking break! there <u>is</u> no "ser- ial killer." stick her name up in neon, there's still no serial kil- ler! and i ain't the only one say- ing it. everyone in this building is saying it. and i mean <u>everyone</u>.
i was wondering...  do you have dinner plans?
then why especially does it have to be in german?
your wheel!  at fifteen em-pee-aitch i roll out!  i double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  the uzi!
mr. guild means guests!  oh, there are two more to come.
of course not.
sorry.
nothing.
what are you so scared of?
have him peel the top label back.
it'll only take 20 minutes or so. you can pick it up at the window down the hall.
i'm very aware of that.
nothing. i felt sad, i put myself on the circuit. it was a mistake.
it's definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
not necessarily bad! if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
yeah, fell down and hit a rock. not as bad as it looks.
worse... you're in texas.
what happened?
great. i'll pick you up around eight o'clock. is that good?
quiet!... quiet!!!... awright, everybody, nick has a few words.
...no. i never saw him with anyone else.
liza sutton is dead.
this is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. we can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
that door is a safely hazard.
what?
my suitcase is gone.
we go out, smash 'em now?
oh no.  shit.  i didn't know he would call you.  god, you must think |i'm a total nuisance.
cut.
you know what i think? i think our luck has just about run shit out...
all the dads are gonna be there.
well, may i offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
what?
you're talking through your hat now.
oh, sh-
good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
i apologize for that scene with my husband.  you must have overheard.
you want me to go around --
so where are all your toys?
okay, stop being so dramatic.
something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under place denfert.
i didn't lie.
oh, behave!
no, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
i've got you, keitel blacksmith. if you go... i go too...
bird flying south-you think he sees that line? rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. so why should a man?
everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
is everyone here?
i said shut the fuck up --
how can i know such a thing?
oh?
johnny?  did you see ben?
about a dozen.
whoa, i knew you were going to say that.  i absolutely anticipated that, nick.  but i said to myself, charlie, charlie, we can move up on this, so go find nicklaus... he'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
sir?
big on the musical comedy, huh?
were you expecting anyone? tonight?
she was good for you.  and so beautiful and intelligent. you knew her, right?
the what?
this is way too creepy.
i'm so glad to see you.  what's the occasion?
get me one of the disks. ask a czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. you'd better keep clear of your apartment too. do you know someone with a phone?
and where did you sit that morning?
if you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what i'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
king of the housecalls! master of the living room!
then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
hello?  it's just me and you again.
pretty close.
i'm not stupid.. i know how this is supposed, to work.
there are important papers from --
you sent my assistant on an errand.
that was because of... the reputation the gang had.
you're wasting your time, already been tried.
no.
no.
you're ayip!
good...
that's why i'm crying.
so. are we ready?
very interesting, bob. let's make a note of that. andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. he never put it in. he lied about that, too.
i've been seeing johannsen in chemistry.
okay, dad.
yes, please.
michael - why would he want to hurt stu...?
the fingerprints.
but it's not his. how can they arrest future man?
nothin' will happen to you. you get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
i object, your honor...
well what do you want to talk about?
that was about as grim as it gets.
yes
i was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  take a look for yourself.
c'mon, pal.
hey -- your prayers have been answered. i'm leaving.  in just a couple of days.
damn god!
it worked when you were in sixth grade.
you wanna release your air tanks?
they're right here.
with light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
you keep drivin' down ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. we're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  hey, where's melanie?
a basic kill. banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. my boys have been all over this. it's a dead end.
he can tell you're an animal nut. you are, aren't ya?
we saw it. all craft prepare to retreat.
she comes in the daytime.  she still with me, my denver.
where'd estes go?
this i gotta see.
really?
senator paine, if i could do just that one thing while i'm here, i-- i'd feel that i--
and i keep, you know, it's-
i couldn't mail it; i didn't know your address. but i had a landmark. i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you.
you've got no choice.
cause you're the man, right?  the magic man.  if it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
oh no, no, no!  you've got to be able to fix me!  please, susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
yeah. i was going to kill him from the inside.
more.
put up your kickstand, freak.  start talking, or we're out the door.
how long?
just like that, huh?  you're not even gonna give me a chance?
you hungry or thirsty, or both?
no. my name is quintero. mister quintero.
how could i not? she had to know.
who is it you wish to see, sir?
just tell me. do you want me to go? do you want me to stay?
oh, come now...
that bag's full of fuckin' chips you
no, no, no.
kat, stop it. you do. you can’t even look me in the eye. you went back to the states when we split up.
no.
i don't know, clarence, "doctor zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
i know it's not the greatest.  it's commercial.
what a pity.
leon! what in heaven's name...!
you are my friend.
it's hers. where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
is that your idea of a joke?  i don't remember...  take my advice, bumstead.  get off this case.  now.
and go to confession.
don't you think you should call a backup?
the fact is... we'd like you to give phil another chance.
hey, i'm sooze.
nothing further, your honor...
mm-hm.  1862. okay, good. i'll call you right b-
see.  ain't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me.  that's where he belongs anyways.  me and jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes.  he was just a pup then . . .
he's a mess!
how do you know you saw it?
you can't talk in brownsville?
concerned. i'm just the hall monitor here.
that is correct.
mother.
gee -- i don't know... the space man, i guess.
was that like a homo-sexual remark?
earlier today you tried to tell me something, willow.
but you wanted to.
lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. you saved my life. i never could have made it alone.
minus one.
one other thing. about this kid, this student of yours -- leer -- james leer. you wouldn't know how i could get in touch with him, would you?
what about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  that's the only reason we came out here. we'd have to abandon them all.  we'd be broke.
would i mind? do i have a choice?
p-a-r-a-s-o...
it was a long time ago, daniel.  we were young, different people, heading in different directions. that's all.
my wife is not the issue here. i hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  i didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in korea took them from me but i went out and achieved anyway. i can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
go ahead.
logically, you couldn't be the witch, because she was old back when he was young.
your folks live there?
you like this shit?
we have nothing to discuss.
about ready for another drink?
and you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
i was nervous -
wha... ?
what do you mean?
i have'na been able ta --
how long can you stay?
you made a choice once.  do you think you would make that same choice again?
nobody remembers that.
my son --
she's an officer.  there's a higher standard.
why do you wanna know so bad?
no, this ain't gonna work either. it's half chocolate, half vanilla.
it is not for us to burn her, my lord.  that is your prerogative.
she gonna be long?
maybe he's wise.
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500. you driving this car?
can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
can i take the car?
help him!! promise me you'll help him!
i told you! i told you i saw a --
what's it like?
the key!
i owe you nothing.
not the only one.
hello, there. what can i get you?
what would you like to talk about.
your husband! mrs. robinson! there's something we could have a conversation about.
you can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  the few voters there are in this district look up to corbett, and i'm not about to alienate them.
well, how would you define to parties"? because we ordered a deli platter at this one denominator drill session--
flying the plane.
red-and-blue tuinal, lipstick-red seconals.
but, buzz, you know i never --
hey!!
with... with annie, of course.
you  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, i'm--
i do?
you want anything?  a drink?
...one shot...
oh, listen to teacher's pet.
you bastards, i said twenty!
what are you going to do?
what's wrong with applejack?
isn't that awfully forward?
troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
protection?
wait. there's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  it put the chillun to sleep.
how'd you know i was here?
once this was a relationship based on love. now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
anything else?
later. listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
about what?
that little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, alvy.
he's getting a break, ain't he? he's front page.
you drive, i'll handle the video, okay?
his name is robert paulson!
yeah.
mike's gotta go.  nice to meet you.
did i say that?. i didn't mean it. or did i?  sometimes i think it would be fun.  go ahead, you better leave now. i can't open myself to you now. i'll tell you a little secret.  i want to die.
that ought to be fun.
oh. i believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
who the hell are you?
nick...
i am?
no--i'm sorry.
you mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
you're gonna be me.  you're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
let's stay for a while.
how long's this going to go on, wilhelm? i say von der null, you say von der null, i say von der null, you say von der null, we could go on all day. you know who von der null is, don't you? edwin von der nuell, music critic.
vietnam?
please, sheriff.  you'll see we dug it up.
i need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  what i'm gonna do isn't very legal.
you did this once it didn't work out.
mr. president, good to see you again, sir.  sorry about all that.
here give me the flowers, i'll do something with them. thank you. now you better go. maybe i'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. i have a boyfriend now you know. and we're pretty serious. he gave me a ring.
i was just thinking about my mom.  she wouldn't leave him.  i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  i mean it was dark outside and in.  but we never talked about it.
she likes to play bingo.
dolores.
yes.
does it hurt?
he couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
it's not much, but it should get you to switzerland.
yeah— us golden warriors.  you're a good kid, jimmy, a good tough kid. we stick together, huh, kid?
there was a prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at pisa so he could die with a view of the tuscan hills. am i that prince? hana laughs.
the next half of the game takes place in arcade's brain, the city of truth. it's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. screamer comes faster here.  on level four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  gotta time it right though.
okay, okay, okay--
really?
okay? goodbye.
this psycho can.
that wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
encourage them to be bolder.
please, honey, let me in.
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
nice night.
yes, sir.
not any more.
they're not just our business managers, panes.
do what?
holy shit.
why?
you want her right now?
he unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. no more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
sorry...
are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
... that's great.
we could use... his computer, to... just e-mail those suckers right ou...
i love christmas in turkey.
he wasn't lying about marco:  he's thirty stories down on the street. the other man is heinrich, and i found his body upstairs.  and his bag is missing.
california? is your name felson? eddie felson?
antiques? what the fuck do we know about antiques? we rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
mr. millaney?
sir, i--
that's my business.
do you think that's such a good idea?
-- fezzik, please --
'cause she will tell you.
we've got to take this slow...
there's an infinitely greater danger. if--  listen.  the only thing octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  to do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, sl 270.
who is this?
me and bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
'the work,' jesus, ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
...on payday! the only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, al.
sorry, but i like the way he looks and talks to me.  and vice versa. okay?
are they still here, otho?
yes.
hi, buddy.  how's my sweetheart who never told on me when i was bad?
i have found you. the queen. an apple. tomorrow. sir gawain...
who're these guys?
i've disturbed	you. i'm sorry -
it's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
and a mr. michael lowenstein, i don't know what he does.
yes.
to bembry? is bembry your friend?
i don't know. santa claus. i had my son's picture in it. gabe's picture. it's the only one i had.
sooner... or later... i'll have to stop.
there are no rules!  why the fuck are you doing this?  the nite owl made you.  you want to tear all that down.
okay...i believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into ufo's or atlantis, you've lost me.
you said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
do you believe him?
that's sarah?  i can see what you mean.
you flirt with me, then you run cold.  you lead me on, then slap me down.  i don't go for being jerked around.
mr. powers, my job is to acclimate you to the nineties. you know, a lot's changed since 1967.
goin' to see my kid.
oh god, stephen, what's going on with you?
she lied to me. i mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. no. not in my house. the truth is a stranger. and this is why ray and marcia are the way they are. marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "how do they find me" she says. ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. i'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... oh, man... are you all right?
we still have to get out of here.
...i know you're down, but you know when you're down, drew, there's no place to go but up.
what do you mean police dog?
can't hardly tell. don't swallow the blood -- go for his ribs. don't let 'im breathe.
that's why there's a dead one on the ship.  it ran out of blood.
so don't show a picture.
i'm the ebay boy, remember? i can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
so what?
i'll tell you what, barbara.  i don't think we survived that crash.
yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
look, mr. charnier, you got to be reasonable.
i know. it doesn't make any sense. that's why i trust it.
nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
how do you do mr. gekko. i'm bud fox.
don't. don't be embarrassed. i should never have let you think that...  i am in love with my wife.
finally, i'd like you to join the drama club. rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings.
why don't you step out of the car, son?
no-one should think themselves wiser than me!  it is not for any of the queen's subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning.  it is the queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely!
nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  this kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  i'm gonna need--
i came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. i want things to be as they were.
the entire school heard it. it wasn't something one could miss.
ben -- i want you to give her a call.
we decided...
cover the ribs -- look here, elbow down, tight -- tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
yes.  there's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. there's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
well he missed a great pot of stew!
occasionally.
jennifer.
i have to talk to frank, is he nearby?
think about it. on the off chance i get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. you took my mother, so i took yours. big sympathy factor. maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. it certainly fucked you up. it made you have sex with a psychopath.
excuse me, dr. macfarlane --
oh!
if it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
that's great. i'm thirty-five years old. just over six feet tall. i weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
just go to lunch.
not very well.
yeah?
oh yeah.
well, that ain't fair to her.  a single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
that's razor and blade.
that’s every man within a five mile radius.  including you.  that’s why you’re here, isn’t it? you think i can’t do it. you think i’m going to screw up. or get myself killed.
yes, all right, i'll wait for you. good-by. 
tell him we're busy.
who am i?
beth.
because i could come...
is that big?
my shit is together.
it's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it.
will you get time off to do that?
nix, flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in dutch.
that's your theory?
you mean,  this ring?
think about it: after you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
i am one, dad!
no way.
i'm a woman -- a lonely woman. i have few friends.
i don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, i'm getting out of here.
i'm in the middle of an interrogation, captain.
i've no influence with mr. holland.
money.
you called the police?
a perfect moment?
diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  you seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
...feels like you.
home!
she's protecting the doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
who has your undies, walter?
you don't believe me?  look in the garage.
yes am.
i never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
you know how this is gonna go!
eight years.
he's right. you'd feel much better about it.
"materiel"? what do you mean by that?
kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  you're a rational person. you're a trained psychiatrist.  you know the difference between what's real and what's not.
drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
you and your cards. meet a rich man! i look for them with money. what rich man hasn't money. and for what was i born if it wasn't for money? you're not telling me anything.
oh god...you knew.
and every week these alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  make us feel good to be alive.
see them?  what do you mean? physically?
hi--!  the gun was empty!
i think you're right.
we're alive.
no -- they're... for my grandmother. she's in a hospital nearby.  thought i'd kill two birds with one stone.
no more... please...
she mustn't -- don't you let her --
what are they?
hey, stu, why so glum? everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
i tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to atlantic city.
rivers of the stuff!
doubtful. what did he say?
he creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
yes, i'm sorry.
spunky. he told you about that?
you're not seriously considering sending him?
engines off.
no.
it ain't here.
just tell 'em -- now and then.
john mason.  ' don't be shocked.  i don't have much time.  please listen carefully  ....
i can't wait to get there.
nikki! great! did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
it was going to be a surprise!
so this z...he fancies himself an individual?
you all sure about this?
they gave me life, mama.
where is he?
reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
alfred has supported me my whole life.  now i'm going to pay him back. i'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
oh, i don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because i made that possible!
good day to you, m'lords.
hey --
and you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
i'll stay.
hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. get a car of your own.
oh, right, right... 
he'd assume we had.
willow!
you flatter me.
ehh...i'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best jag people in town...so uhm.
thanks...for all your help.
guy says he made the trade in gillette, wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
just step from the car.  nice and slow.
the moment i saw you.
you're really crazy.
i've never been to earth. i've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
sleep okay?
maya, how are you?
"gone live?"
what?
what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  was he desperate enough to create one?
you know how it is, colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--i remember my first hitch--
there seems to be a discrepancy.
see ya, kate.
is he gon' be gone long?
no —- not yet.
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
i don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
way to go, alfie!  how many people did you break that thing in front of.   good help's hard to find.
why?
your honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  including mr. hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
christ. you didn't just see what happened. they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
admiral, may i suggest that dr. mccoy is correct. we must help chekov.
i felt like black.
i will be glad to leave this island. it has too much of that old dark world about it. i will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
well, if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
addison, just a few minutes ago. when i told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything i wanted-
to the first letac engineer to go into production on prototypes.
to explode, of course.
yes, sir, he was.  but he said he was obligated to lecture at johns hopkins university.
incomplete, i might add.
rita... i know what you're doing.
hey, what do you think you're doing? put that stuff back!
did you?
it was in his bag. now it's not.
i'm sorry, i just feel like –i know i shouldn't ask, i just need some kind of help, i just, i have a deadline tomorrow-
look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. i'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. no one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
what makes you say that?
i've heard that one before, too. i remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  huh!
well then do a good job of it! get over there, and search thorwald's apartment! it must be knee-deep in evidence.
just tell me about the goddamn article.
walter, you fuck!
you evil this morning.
frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
you... you can't do that!
i just want to see the basketball scores.  it's important.
the guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
oh, judy!! when he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? what a shame! but he knew he was safe. you couldn't talk. didn't he give you anything?
keep still, constable.  you were half-drowned when they found you.
stop it, jez. don't do that.
where's the towel?
old building and loan pal, huh . . .
look -- i think i should be going --
i tell you, charley, i haven't made up my mind!
oh, will you help me?  can you help me?
forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
you awake?
direct hit. he's resetting his shield harmonics...
listen, if you could talk to them  i would really appreciate it. i'm really late. i have a lunch appointment at hubert's in fifteen minutes.
i'd like to stay. i'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' pa get settled in a nice little place. i sure wish i could see you then. but--  --i guess i won't never be able to do that. not now.
how you doing, man?
because i'm tired of not understanding things.  cops, mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out i really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
let's find a place out of the rain. i'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
yes, well... okay, right. i'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
i don't know. either she has it or the feds.
actually, i just had an amusing thought.
doctor gynde. my whole family's sick. what's going on?
c'mon bill... you've got some sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
don't talk.  don't talk!
i've got something important to do. i can't leave.
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
what?
i won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. i promise. you'll keep...
forty-two was a lean year around here.  the war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall.  not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  at that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
rick...
i'd nearly given up on you.  i was about to leave.  i do have other clients.
huh?
well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. which i am, and you want to be. know what i mean?
sir, if you were not a captain, i would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
that fucking bastard! that fucking sick fucking bastard!
ricky?...that i don't care they stole the contracts?
...wanna savor this.
lovely, isn't it?
let me put it to you this way... whether i'm here... or whether i'm not...i'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
yes, i do. please, rose, be a good sport.
what's the lighthouse?
what did you think of lippman's column this morning?
what happened with nunez?
where's dickie?
hey, professor tripp.
are you kidding?
i remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
made it. maxine. maxine, maxine, maxine.
you girls aren't from brooklyn or anything?
she is a dancer! and a lovely one! you would like her very much! shall we dance?
thanks, comrade.
well... it's getting kind of late.
thank you, melvin. you overwhelm me.
sorry to interrupt you, mr brett, but i have a message for you.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "naomi forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. but while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets chandra. and it's serious, immediate love. so in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in north america.
your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  you're so funny.
son of a bitch!
excuse me?
she's my girlfriend.
...thank you...  and how are you this evening, doctor? no, we know that you're awake...
oh, why are you making those faces?
very little.
depends on big brother.
thanks, josie. this wasn't as bad as i thought.
frostbite. gangrene. a simple diagnosis.
how is old chief bloomenbergensteinenthal? is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
no, you shouldn't have stopped. but you got away with it. important thing is are you sure you're all right?
oh my god...
it's the only way.
you and regan?
did you say cops?
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
this man is deeply disturbed, he...
all wings report in.
not if you think like a vegan.
i went through this with an investigator this morning. if i could--
what? we're the leadership, you and me. there ain't enough of us to...
give me the god damn gum.
why do you think you're here?
that’s right. and auto supply...
i didn't know i was asleep... what time is it?
carmine? he was here before. i saw him. he had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
oh! italian, right?
you? you went by the book?
any court in the land would understand. we'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
um, i think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
strange.
i know it was bad, honey. i'm sorry...
so this means you've reconsidered our deal on mr. lovejoy?
sam, for godsake.
somebody robbed the vatican.
it also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
what surery?
ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
i don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
i called everyone, everywhere!  you just vanished!  you could be dead!
you smell that?
and i don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  i know what you're up to.  don't think i don't.  and if anyone tries to get in here -- i've got rope.  i'll hang myself before it gets to me.
geez, i feel bad for him. maybe we should've told him abou -
are you hurt?
gardens.  all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. they're like little villages.
...-m-means, mason.  
<u>wonderful</u> scr...
what are you talking about?
honey, you all right? 
i'm scared.
let up on the brake!
oh, jesus!  hey.  how about food? i forgot to ask to have food on board.
lemonade?
we can cut that out later. apollo creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
don't hit me.
i lied.  alright?  my end is my business. your end's twenty-five.  in or out. you tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
no.  you just looked as if you did.
you hear me? i believed you.
hey, relax satan. don't get all worked up. you're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
you never know what's over the horizon, data. before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
by a son'a weapon.  there's no doubt about it, sir. that's what made data malfunction.
you better not either.
a little bit. is that good or bad?
good enough.  and unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
alfred, are you...?
who asked you?
well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
that's the mickey and mallory way.
you really want to know?
oh!
he got it in the belly. he's still alive, but won't be for long.
ikset-kiba.  me imanetaba oum dalat!
i'm preparing her for shinzon. to sooth him as she soothes you. to stand at his side as she does at yours.
look what the cat dragged in.
"poet?"
what are you after them for?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... i keep them hungry.  when... when do we think this man arrives.
tough shit, bro. this ain't miami. you want something, talk to me.
holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
we'll take the money and disappear! we can do it, spend it on the move. even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
ah... peter finch.
think i'll look aroun' an' see if i can't meet me a girl.
styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
sure. but eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
reed said it'd be weeks till --
will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
we've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving east.
you hungry? pace and i ain't had dinner yet.
someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
it was him, man!
...well, there was some friction: i wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but koessler wouldn't allow it. low felt koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. koessler had low reassigned to the pacific northwest, seattle. you know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? that's where they stuck dick low.
goodnight dims.
oh baby.
i done it again.
keaton, we gotta go. they're gonna find him.
that's a fine thing to throw up to me after all i've been to you....
do not confuse yourse{fi why? we must strike a heavy blow. this cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
a king must marry, after all.
then how did you catch me, will?
he's ten.
do you have family here?
access granted.  male or female?
so.  where have you been staying for the last week?
no.
see, the jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the sabbath from the week, the jew from the gentile.... as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
sinister is what i'd call it...! ours is so much cheerful!  why don't you come and stay with me... there's plenty of room in my suite.
but you're the key.  the one he wants to play the game with.
they show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. especially the big one.  we bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  that one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  she's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
danny, come here!
yeah.
what time do they expect us?
two heads.
i guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance!
have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
but alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
yah, that's a good one.
do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
you ever been near a meat packing plant? my father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
what?
what is bruce doing ?
here you are. don't let anyone know where you got them.
very good. now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
shit.
i'll never make it... can't we stop just for a few minutes...
what's on your mind?
well, flea, i appreciate the respect you just showed me.  but i don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  it's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
yeah, you don't remember?
here's to you, sir.
thank you.
what's wrong?
maybe i'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. in south africa the numbers were small...
that was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
you got it bad, baby. you need vegas.
he's a regular humanitarian. and all this time i thought he was just a tool.
yeah. probably.
yes.
figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
i dunno. i guess larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  and he's only waiting for one thing:  that some god up there will turn him into a fish! how long has that moron been down there?
what are you going to do to him?
i told you before, grimes liked to be obvious.
employer?  the president?
uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
i don't think so. i mean. actually, he robbed bob's house.
oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  i understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  the 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  i've found it.
he did? when?
i think i just got my period.
i'm just trying to get in my house!
you got directions?
i'm too old for me. that's my predicament.
she said yes.
how are you feeling?
i'm causing trouble?! you're a pain in the butt! you newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest. i'm just sixteen, you know? who the hell cares what i think?
you wanna dance?
...you take that anacott steel?
thanks.
oh, my!
yes, sir.
i wish i had your natural talent. god only makes that visit once in a while.
i'm gonna hurl, david. i swear to god.
brooke, i believe you. but a jury is gonna want an alibi.
well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
this you're familia' with.
uh, huh...
uh huh, i wanna hear this part.
sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
no, gale, i don't have any rights. you made sure of that.
nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..i don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. i refuse..that's right..that's right...
to your family.
fun-ny. see you.
you try and have a good time.
did he come in with you?
that is the racket harry lime organized.
who?
gotta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one, or close enough. gonna take time.
no. the bathroom is off limits -and when i go to sleep they go to other programming. unless i get up. then they go back on the air. unless i get up to go to the bathroom, i guess, then -
what's going on?
you did okay, back there.  i was fairly impressed.
they always let me do anything. i don't want to pay for it.  i never paid for it in my life.
why didn't annie stay for dinner?
i am...  and this my trusty servant, patsy. we have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at camelot..  i must speak with your lord and master.
it's...him.
you're sure? it's cold.
in six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
we can say whatever we want. we can shout... we can complain... look...  the service in this hotel is terrible!  see? nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. that's freedom.
what are we doing?
i don't know what to think, marlon. maybe i'm going out of my mind, but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
anna--
i haven't seen him tonight.
why don't we go down to key biscayne together?  just the two of us.
you'll learn as you get a little older, jim.
if memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. by the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
-- what's the problem, honey?
he's heading under -- !
it still doesn't mean...
all you been through... i ever tell you what a good friend you are?
i wanted to come home, grandmama - and i did. i came back to my home with you.
no.
you work for ryuji?
no, i've never played anything cool in my entire life.  spike, who i'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
a. slushee. don't tell me.  abraham slushee. third president of the united states.
hey, skip.
it's about the three musketeers.
just like old times.
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
county hospital, right?  1989.  the "immaculate escape" -- am i right?  why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom?
how much is there?
this is real, bananahead!
hello, mitchell. having fun?
wonder what?
wha'...what are you doing here?
everybody goes there.
what are you doing?
i'm telling you, you got her spooked. she won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  we'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
you do?
and she bought that?
and as an investment in the future...
but wait. i still don't understand what you do.
i go running down there.
get some sleep.
why should she? after all—
you heard right.
you disdain accepted wisdom?
... best shot...?
what?
they were jealous of him.
all right.
he's a clumsy git. never watches where he is going.
i'm only safe in the russian zone... i'm safe as long as they can use me...
ask him.
no, i think you were.  come on, admit it.
you were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. yeah, blow me, i'm drunk.
can i buy this otis redding single off you?
foreman wants to get the ore out. miner wants to get his brothers out. in one piece.
we made it!  damn, we made it!
don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor independence day, and don't tell me i'm overreacting when i'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
c'mon, it all worked out. you came out okay in the end...
it'd never get through. all packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. you didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
tom, i never thought you were a bad consigliere, i thought santino a bad don, rest in peace.  he had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when i had my misfortune.  michael has all my confidence, as you do.  for reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside, i'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
you leave the kid alone.
it's a spice rack.
c'mon, michael.  i want to go.
that was two years ago.  john was still in love with me.  he wouldn't leave me alone.
no.  he smokes.
dad --
yeah, well i never wanted to get slaughtered much.
say it and you'll believe it. life is good. say it.
i thought half of it was your brother's?
answer me a couple things?
this one will.
it may be that - i could confer with my colleagues on this. and get back to you.
st. michael's.
why are there no photographs in these frames?
okay.
maybe you should be.
i'm not cryin' because of me, i'm cryin' because of somebody else.
because, if the british got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  and the revolution would be finished.  tell king louis, it's that bad.
i don't care for him.
you know what we ought to do tonight?
he teach you to do it?
without grendel knowing about it. b-i-n-g-o and bingo was his name-o. counterfeit c.d.s.  tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
brimmer.
glenn michaels.
well, stay away from them.  don't get close.
you think i should go to the party, mr. marliston?
you're leaving?
but putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
<u>everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  for your little story to fly.  i mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
just goes to show you.
perhaps a little refreshment first? a little coffee, or a little chocolate?
i'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows.
never a pair. i have never had a pair.
that's the price, my brother.
thanks, mr. eddy.
all the same, someday you'll lie to laszlo. you'll be there.
i want sleep more than anything. except maybe, food.
why can't we agree on this?
martha, it's you.
-- usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. why?  why do you want to know all this?
like her mother.

hi.

yes.
there's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
i've covered everything. and you're the best, so--

i was supposed to take the children to new england next week.
oh...it's not working right. you're home early.  did i scare you?
what happened?
hey, the terminator! blow 'em away ollie.
she told us you went after junior to save your old man's hide. you got some balls goin' after that psycho.
the cops!  what kinda bullshit is this?  is this america or -- ?
all right, say "airport ho-jo."
that would be nice.
stay, adrian.  i just -- every once in a while, i need to talk to someone human.  he doesn't think like we do.  he doesn't even feel what we feel.  i mean -- he even scares the research teams.
that way it sets.
midge!
sharp bank, chewie.  let's turn this bucket around.  you heard me, turn around!  full power on the front shield.
ah, no sir. i had planned to see them in the morning.
so when i left, she gave me these books.
last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man, which i always hate because it looks bad on the report.
you're going to be hungover for three days. like those guys on "oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
the front door is open.  will you be back?
did you ride past casey becker's house?
you gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
i said i'm a dying man!
where you gonna be?
ya little bitch, you like it don't you! you like it this way -- rough and hard. gotta go fuck around on me, like your mama, but you always gotta come home to daddy, don't you, cause you know daddy's the best.
alright, corporal, you take bennington, harrisville, acworth and the farms along black swamp.  i'll take the north side of the river. we'll meet at snow's island.
jeff wigand, michael moore.
i can't see!  i can't see!  daddy!
but it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
you read russian?
and i really don't know your noises yet.
am i right?
hmm.
mister powell?
wasn't no problem a mine.
i'm leaving.
did you have a pleasant trip?
the day you open a '61 cheval blanc, that's the special occasion.
what?
do you really think i should go to the commune?
i don't need it that badly. i don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
will you come to him on your knees?
pardon, good mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
well, i've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, i guess.
if it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
that's a strange angle.
as opposed to now, kid car crusher?
hey, jan.  see if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
teasing you is completely unfair.
how will you make sure i'll have the list in three days?  it's been a delight.  now where can i drop you dear boy?
what are you up to, nicole?
i'll pay it back to you saturday - on the level i will. give a guy a break, will you? i've got to get it back in my account. if helen ever finds out that i—
what? deep down inside?
i think you got no choice.
what?
who is it?
...i don't want that asshole near my money. i don't even want him in the bar.
i'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  who should i tell him called?
biology, mostly.
by yourself?
it's been about a year and a half.
well, not this.  i was doing the pentagon scene few nights ago.  got some fresh stuff -- about you.  you may be in a hostile camp.  i think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
you said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
fuck, it's freezing.
i gotta hit the library. anatomy. some of us have real majors. you gonna be okay, sid?
you drunken idiot! arrest him! the idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
at the wedding?  you invite him?  bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
pharmacy crowded?
shall we move closer to the fire?
he wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
give it up.  if you threw yourself-
four minutes past. please come.
who is there?
that is a marvelous image, walter. because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
when do you want the assembly?
what? what do you stand for?
he wouldn't kill anybody...
what about when she identifies him?!
no, it's five thousand dollars.
never trust anybody.  you goin' sick?
he doesn't know when to give in. they'll kill him.
did you ever see 'eldorado?'
oh, it's just so romantic.  i just want to put on a long gown...
loud and clear.
i just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
sir, someone mentioned you received the navy cross.  may i ask what you got it for?
it's those rocks, up there.
i'm not saying anything. besides, you're one to talk. you're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
i hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  yes.  it's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
what have we missed?
lost. it feels lost. this was hers?
is it good?
please don't go.
who are you?
bye-bye.
and when is the countdown supposed to expire?
sorry i'm late. richard called.
why, you're the purtiest girl i've seen in all my wandering. didn't nobody never tell you that, ruby?
we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  are you acquainted with a david logan?
i haven't time to argue. i'm a working girl.
they're going to hang you.  why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
it's all arranged. i'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany mr. merrick. you'll be using the royal entrance and princess alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
mulder --
merry christmas, jack.
no, no of course not.  it's skye fucking davidson, for fuck's sake.
were you tempted?
what?
yes.
well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
you wanna know why i stood up for this show?
so...
you don't want to know.
an angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at quick stop convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. division of taxation calls the state board of health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. you say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  it's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
yes, sir.
hey, miles. long time no see.
- end where i began.
yeah. hey, clay.
yes, of course.
you look different. i mean you look good.
ethan.  heís out of pocket.
which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
this is a hot run.  beat it.  you're late.
legs giving you trouble?
just someone from new hampshire!
i mailed it to you on wednesday.
no!
let him try it.
keep the goddam blanket on.
i think maybe over a hundred.
my name's frank. and furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
i can believe that.
can i buy you dinner sometime soon?
i thought i'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. as a child, i never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. buddy... i have got a confession to make.
yeah, what happened there.
i can't believe we just had our senior prom.
she wasn't here when i brought danny home from --
john.  listen.  i want to talk to you. permit me to do this a second.  i'm older than you.  a man acquires a reputation.  on the street.  what he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...i said "ten," you said "no." you said "twenty." i said "fine," i'm not going to fuck with you, how can i beat that, you tell me?...okay.  okay.  we'll...okay. fine.  we'll...alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. that's fine.  for now.  that's fine. a month or two we'll talk.  a month from now.  next month.  after the thirtieth.  we'll talk.
hi.
what? the tapes?
come on, what was it?
good night, daphne.
when the hell did you write that?
i hope so. is that the end then?
who proved the theorem.
it isn't right to make him suffer...
it's against the rules. dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
what way would you put it?
good morning to you, too.  you look good.
patrizia, i'm afraid.
doctor jacobson?
have you checked the...
cuticle lacerations.
...has been simply unbearable.
it's okay, really.
fuckin' a.
the world is full of guys.  be a man.  don't be a guy.
we have a lot in common.
there's no name for it... but it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
eddie, which dress do you like better?
a new outfit bought the red car.  some big company called cloverleaf industries.
i want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
you found her.
colonel reed...
that's not bad. how about a float of george washington crossing the delaware?
so what's the scam, eddie?
i resign.
i'm babbling.
no, i didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
uh-huh.
i'm a robber.
-- where does this come from? --  how do you have my picture?
you work in the insurance department?
no! you couldn't imagine -
ah-ha. favouritism. but i so want mozart.
what are you doing here, where've you been?
what doesn't?
we'll speak soon.
mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate worley, and we're all sorry.
please hurry.
were you with jamie?
okay, let's see...got a pos- itive on her.  she's sarah connor, works as a legal--
cause i don't take acme dumb pills.  i don't know what you're up to, lady, but i'm gonna nail you for the acme murder.
is the baby okay?
i believe you sent for me.
drop yours. i'm gunshy.
'morning, dick.
mama let me help you.
... you want to be margo's new understudy.
the hipster!
i don't understand...
i loved you ellen - why did you do this?
so whaddya think.  i mean... i could... uh... get a job.  of some kind.  i mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
don't do this to me....
we can discuss all this some other time, susan.  right now -
as you see.
well he said...  you know in his way... you know what i mean? besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. so, dr. scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. he's laughin' you know and shakin'... son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... it was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. you know how he is.
so?
it was called 'slave of love' when i bought it. next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
he really believes jason's still alive, doesn't he?
funny, i don't get that feeling. maybe it's because you found out i'm bill parrish's daughter.
such as.
i was a friend of your sister's.
yes, doctor sheppard.  we called you back but you weren't home.  we have the book.
who's to say you can't make things better?
lloyd.
he's taking a nap.
yeah.
you mean we are not children of satan?
cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. you must sneak over zere and shut it off before i return with terrance and phillip or the alarms will sound and i will be shot full of holes. got it?
bad and illegal behavior. that's what i mean. ok?  mischief.  now have you been doin' some drugs today?
how you doing, chewbacca?  still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
sure. i met you.
i understand... if you could tell me who employed you, miss sessions. that could help us both.
i don't want you to get hurt.
so they'll put her back in! it's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
what is he planning on telling them?
we had to see what your deal was. i'm just a little superstitious.
oh shit.  i'm sorry.
yeah?
stephen... i... can i talk to you a second...
did i miss something?
oh no, i'm okay.
who cares!
someone...?
when i was here?  when i ran away. i used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
well... that's my business, madame.
when i first met marylin -- well, we were crazy about each other. not emotionally, of course. we just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
you know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. and don't ask me why.
well...whatsamatter?  run in with the law?
zorin will eat him alive!
you picked another winner!
i am not a seaman.  but i heard it is no more than a week at sea.  i hope you are not too disappointed.
what?!
it doesn't matter...he's next to you.  you know, i always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. why didn't you?
we'd cover more ground if we split up.
i seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
no.  you just described every great success story.  alright, it's alright.
you've just decided, is that right?
is he....?
you know what? i feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
this isn't the time --
--i am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
how'd you do out there, jimmy?
maybe just a hint or so. think hard.
i'll take your hat into the cloak room.
how much money do you get?
why?
you'll notice i've asked you nothing.
you comfy?
did he get fresh?
buffy, what is your sitch?  you're acting like the thing from another tax-bracket; it's too weird.
what are they doing, doll?
ah, you gotta be jokin'!  a great man like you... i'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
mr. congeniality?  let him find his own clues.  there's a journal article in this somewhere.
uh.... hi!
and the police did nothing?
yes. under two conditions.
he had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
you bet!
do you think anyone can see us down here?
i know very little about demons, ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. i know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... dante, milton ... but jacob,  this is the 20th century. we don't see demons now.
i have something i have to show you...
listen to yourself.  you say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so i don't care about people."  but, you're already here.  you've been here a long time.  so, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
i don't think so, captain.
and this so-called . . . nuclear man. . . of yours can defeat superman?
then go find a corner. i don't want you in my way.
so what do you think of my father?
like job?
then what's going on?
you're a grown man.  i'm not responsible for you.
bottom, left, right. i have it.
they all know you?
the joe boys in 1980...!
why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
sure, come on. we'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, yakavetta's right hand. he's the one who set me up. then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone i was as good as dead. he goes in there every wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. never misses.
"liebestraum."
what's that got to do with the radiator hose?
ma'am, i am the deputy of this town.
kiss my ass.
you think what we're doing is so wrong?  and what are you doing? pursuing goodness?  for what?  to answer to some supreme tribunal?
when you do have one i'd like to hear it.
yes. heating and air conditioning.
rule number one: don't get involved with patients. rule number two: don't get involved with patient's daughters. you understand?
lloyd says margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, eve. you've worked wonders with margo...
i don't know!  it had something to do with mars.
this is going to do nothing.
well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in boca for a week. and then, when we get back, morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the jdl.
don't be.  i never saw him after i was 15.  went into the military early.  so all this talk about "my job's temporary, i got big plans," it's all bullshit.
no...look i'm busy...
that's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
please continue, sergeant.
what the hell is this?
how did i get here last night?
simple simon on the rock, go caller.
what is it?
so you got a 'roid going with jackson or what?
xxxxxx
hi.
take the money and walk away!
spock, it's me, bones! i mean our experience was unique. you really have gone where no man has gone before. can't you tell me what it felt like?
i just give you your life. what you do with it is up to you.
no, 007. it's just that i've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  somehow the reality is never as... satisfying as the fantasy.
of course, of course. leave it to me. how do i authorize a cheque?
he can reason? with the tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
i'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston.
don't look like he missed the sunlight.
you don't say.
who?
where to?
yes?  my <u>promotion</u>...?
what's the matter?
yes, that's perfectly correct.
oh, baby, i'm so sor...
how did you get started working for the spooks?
really...? so what?
who?
some people are very shy by nature.
hello, baby.
kids?
he's dead! everyone's dead! old earth is dead!
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
what difference does it make...?
what're you gonna do?
a year ago.  halloween.  a man and a woman.  in a loft.  you helped to murder them.
no shit, kevin?
i don't recall asking your permission.
i'll do it.  the rest of you continue.
no point fixin' it!
that's hotel life. in one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
i'll be damned if i'm leavin'. that band is too good?
oh, it's open.
why didn't you eat last night?
gun. jesus. turn in the id as soon as you get back. the gun, too. be on the next plane, starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
who do you think you're talking to?
i told you not to hang up on me.
didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
my right nostril?
alright, i'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
three ways, i figured.
me too. that's stupid. name one thing we're gonna need it for.
i want you to give up your work....
let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
shit.
oh. how old?
don't let me down.
the vice squad?
what do you think mrs. graham wants to see me for?
hey, guys. how's it going?
show.  me.  the.  money.
i think it's rather extraordinary.
crikey.
i'll open mine now.
no. i'll wait here.
all the guys i've ever been with... they never want to know me. who i am on the inside. they just want to qet inside. when they do, they think that means they know who i am. that i trust them. that they know me. that there's nothing left to learn.  a guy like you, nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. i figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
i can't tell you how distraught i was.  all night long.  what the hell happened?
can't say.
i'm sorry.
see and raise five.
[i need a driver to drive samuel, the father.]
the enemy is in retreat. there will be no more fighting here.  i came here to visit the crypts. my wife was buried here. what happened to the bodies?
looks more like a morgue to me. those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
now tell me you love me.
"what do we tell him about the guns and money?"
but . . ..that's terrible!
so the aliens can't read our minds.
dr. lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density.
it's only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. it's not anymore.
your imagination runs away with you, jack... those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like i mentioned.  a wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
i have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
hear she's retarded.
yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  this one took some work.
oh there you are.
i think he's high on drugs. he hit me, then took off. i'm afraid to be alone. please come over.
we're getting close...
yes, i promise.
who'd you see, sam? the man on the floor?
well, why so mysterious! come on, spill it.
i wouldn't presume to try.
it's a doctor, isn't it? that's unethical. i'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
she's dead.
you're late, bro!
i suppose it's too late to start over.
what world are you talking about? ain't nothing harmless down here.
he has a phone pole sticking in his chest, i think we don't need an autopsy.
you think i would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
there was no sex.  she was very traditional.  we were waiting until we were married.
why were you so careless?
i knew your managing editor very well.
um... they gave me a limo, uh...
she is.
this letter.  i've never opened it.
i seen him.
they wrong?
yeah, don't stop. keep going.
well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
i was starting to believe you, you know? that you weren't who everyone said. i guess i was wrong --
you look kinda lost yourself.
now blah-blah-blah is all i do. i use my grand i.q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. some genius.
'twas the night before christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring -- nothing -- no action -- dullsville!  you married?
nope.  i've never robbed a bank.
on the train?
well...
mm—hmm.
where’s m?
that's fascinating, vanessa. listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
don't get carried away.
oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. you know,  i'm startin' it-i'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
oh, he'll get married, don't worry, aunt theresa.
need what? civilised order like we have down here? christ!
how am i ever gonna get a girl?? i drive around in a garbage truck
will he be supervised?
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- i'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  courtland wants to...
did you see jack?
my god!
i doubt that.
yeah. one minute you're studying great expectations and the next minute you're drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
i don't want him.
to save the world.
i know a little about psychology. i took three different courses in college. it's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but i took them... and there was one concept i remember very well.
watch my back!
i told you a liter was less than a gallon.
sign here, please.
general mann -- i was told to expect you, sir.  i'm colonel heffner.
how long has this man been here?
which "district" do you belong to?
"--we hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights--"  well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
canyon ahead. i circled once to buy some time to think.
how'd it go in there?
are you really?
okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
on your property?
you need my help?
what do you mean, 'how did he look'?
if it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  tufts, you know.  it still hasn't grown fully in.  the other one is from the islands.  braided hair -- very dark.
cool!
step outside, pal.
good.
they have noble faces.
no.
c-colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but i ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.

aaaaawww man, i wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. it's twelve o'clock, man. i'm home, i'm high --

it's a five-pointed star.
yes.  yes it was.
the fish.  check it....
what do you have here, billy?
...what?
are you out of your mind?!
tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
did you like making love to me?
no.  hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  he said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
and you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. right? does that mean...?

what'd ya mean?
so thrive my soul--
little miss, you can't stay here. you've got to come with me.

my mother.

then it's not an accident that they found us.
i was thinking las vegas.  get some butts in those seats.
well, i tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
dr. isley.  it was like i could feel you in the room.  you're...enchanting. gorgeous.  the most beautiful woman i've ever seen.  if you're..um... free...this evening.

your feet are cold.
no, i don't.
vegas? what'd you think?
can i call my mom? i'd like to tell here how much i've always loved her.
ain't no sense in it, neither. i figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
do i have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. the cult of good will be a memory. i don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. we have a secret mission...

we have to have a long talk about all this.
i wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
fuck you. you owe it to me. tomorrow i'm gonna wake up and i'll be fifty and i'll still be doin' this. and that's all right 'cause i'm gonna make a run at it. but you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. and that's bullshit 'cause i'd do anything to have what you got! and so would any of these guys. it'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.

demolition man.

you can only do what you can do.
how long do i have?
what's wrong?
there's no blood.  where's the fuckin' blood?
you know -- i get the feeling you could use a nap. there's a rest area up ahead. why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
they canned me.  well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
well, i was just messing around over there, thought i'd come over and say hello to you.  i'll try anything once.  what's your name? i said mine.
i've got an idea.
look, miss channing... it's kind of depressing. if you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
how's that?
so you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
why show me?
over? it can't be. i've come to read with her. i promised max.
y-yes.

i love my blender.
i wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
they told me, you might try to talk me into something... you need to rest mr. parker... it's for your own good.  i've been following your story for a long while.  it's a beautiful thing you did.
buttholus extremus.  but hey, you're making progress.
she sure does.
...look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. notice how each one is useful. what a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  so full of..life!

i got a card from your uncle phil in los angeles today, said he went body surfing.
upham?  good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. your father arranged for your sister's abduction. he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. as a clone.  he had different hopes for you. that you would uncover the truth about the project. that you would stop it. that you would fight the future.
alright, i'll tell you what.  i'll put it in the corner of the alcove. if it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  how's that?
as for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! you don't know how lucky you are not to have one. hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. i could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had i not been obstructed by a heart.
again.
goddamnit--
a drink with an umbrella in it....
yes, i do, mr. gardner.
isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
we're on course, major.  just fixed our position on that river back there.
it was we ourselves did that. and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise.
"go back to your banana tree, nigger." no use telling them i came from tottenham.
he might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.

roy --
seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  any questions?
that little shit!
are you listening to me?  you're in a world of shit.  an eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  we got your prints all over the place.  plus the fucking driver's license, frank.  you gotta give me something here. something i can believe.
i cut it shaving; i know, i gotta be more careful.
professor, you ever fly one of these things before?

is that good or bad?
them straw polls is ugly.
hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
are we talking about cocaine again?
oh...and who is it!?
you have a helluva way of asking for help.
i thought he was lying.
sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
one who's not a mutant.
what?
there's this thing out there.  this paternity suit.
very well, thank you. i have something for you, john. i'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
look, you heard what those hookers said. they were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
there seems to be some confusion about your registration. i believe i can find you a place at the ambassador. many persons of the jewish faith find it quite...

silence!!!  now!!!  everyone bow down to me!!!
it's been quite a night. i understand that your understudy - miss harrington - has given her notice.
and another thing. your attitude toward anglos. if you're gonna be a leader ...
you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
how about if i try humility.
when you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
did the cleaning woman come?
you don't need a drink.
pattycake!  pattycake!
really?!  well good for you.
i can't help feeling that i'm cheating when i take them.
yes.
what's your beef, boys? so i'm trading. everybody here is trading. only maybe i trade a little sharper. so that makes me a collaborator.
that's why he goes masked during the day...
you know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your puerto ricans? well out here we got indians. that's just the way it is.
i don't care if i never get home.
tell me more about yourself, mr. boone.  you have a steady companion?
it's very possible ordell's killed somebody.
this is li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  he is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  it's too fine a gift. i cannot accept it.
sorry?
of course! what did you think?
mom, tell him i'm not going.  you already promised me!
no, no that's fine.  so you doing okay?
how is she?
don't look at me.  i'm just a pilot. i got you here... you've got to do the rest.
oh, stop it. but you were having an affair with your college professor. that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "contemporary crisis in western man"!
they call him "the sand spider".				*
this is supposed ta be siam or some such. some kinda lousy b-b-balinese temple. this look like a temple to you? i can't see it myself--
oh yeah, why?
floor probably leaks. this area is full of springs.
where the hell have you been, junebug?
maybe. but i'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
no, give him a living.  but never let him know the family's business. what else, tom?
what about the water...
yeah.  i'm her father.
what's the problem?
now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
very discreet. a note right out in the open like that. next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
thanks, grandpa...
i know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
i figure she can do about four at a time. christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. maybe three.
whatever happened to norman rockwell?
your body is the temple of the lord.
yeah, i do. it's for my girl friend. make it out to ralph.
how'd you know my name was jack?
do you feel better now?
no trouble with the hack bureau?
i have followed my feelings.
what did you do when you were little?
there's no comparison.
they're extremely aggressive birds. plus, their habits are rather filthy.
you do it.
can't it wait?
yes. i understand. a lot of people enjoy being dead. but they are not dead really. they're just backing away from life.  they're players - but they sit on the bench. the game goes on before them. at any moment they can join in.  reach out! take a chance! get hurt maybe. but play as well as you can.  go team, go! give me an "l." give me an "i."  give me a "v." give me an "e." live!!!!!  otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
you know how sometimes neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
well now, miss flaemm, we can talk.
welcome back.
it's not mine.
what's the matter? are you sick?
it look nicer then home!
you're a princess...
they're just copies then.  gotcha.
you don't understand me.
brother, mookie, if i love you i love you, but if i hate you...
...pit bosses, floor managers.
why baseball?
lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. and you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' i do for a weekend once every ten years.
hey, c'mon in, man. i was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' tv.
a bad heart.
this isn't like that queen elizabeth question, is it?
i feel...isolated.  different.  i've got abandonment issues.  my father flew away when i was just a larva. my mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  i feel physically inadequate -- i've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  sometimes i think i'm just not cut out to be a worker.  but i don't have any other options.  i was assigned to trade school when i was just a <u>grub</u>.  the whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
attendant. he'll give us gas. put the gun down. under the seat. under the seat...
what's wrong?
...i didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  we don't know who's straight up, who's not...
a sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
need to have you check these out before he goes on that walker benefit.
go away.
lawyers?
they stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  do you know who i am, sprout? i am torquil, lord of the forest. my men follow no man but me, and i follow no man at all.
saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
it doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick.
behold!
no.
he's a research doctor.  you're dad's a doctor, too --
that's wrong, sam.  you know that. we'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  this is never going to go away...
really--
my dreams of marion are gone. i killed them myself. if i knew i could live with her on the other side of death, i'd welcome it.
this is he?
certainly frank.  darling, get some glasses. we'll have some beer with frank. won't you sit down?
i killed him.
nothin'.  i was just foolin' around.
you wouldn't --
yeah, a long one.
well it is a miracle he ever got back. and, i'm sure, mr. treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
...ixed itself.
what about elliot harmsway? or is this just another one of your stunts?
sir?
you're ruining my life'  because you won't be normal, i can't be normal.
what do you think?
fascinating. what are your plans for this evening?
elsa! elsa, don't move!
escape hatch.
yeah, i did.
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
no. how could he?. don't go. you think i'm crazy, don't you? i want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
i got lost.  oh here ... look at this!
no.
that girl looks just like my old girlfriend gina.
you could do it yourself...
can't say that i have.  can't say i've heard of a lot of people though.
he's shown himself to you... on the deck.  in the storm.
charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
oh mama, i'm so... tired of that song.
because dad left?
hey buddy!  can you let me pull over?  give me some space to pull over.
st. joseph's.
no.
my fuckin' head.
keep it.
...but the word "yet..." yeah, you know what, i'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while i'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  she also said i should throw whatever pitches you call for.
thank you very much. it's a pleasure.
you're not going to do this?
you what?
you know who that is?
jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
take your pick -- they all like you -- i can tell --
that's good.  that's really good.  you have a gift for words.
i'm not cold.
should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to texas first.
yeah.
is that what changed your mind?  the money?
well... it'll probably work out. we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
don't tell me: heavy duty.
yeah, i guess.
sounds more like aids...
i'm talkin' his spiritual mother. maisy blue legs.
sure...
i hate that thing.
you genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. and since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
should i open it now?
are you okay?
you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  can't you see? you'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
you too are lonely.
it's mr brown, ma'am.
the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
okay, i promise i will.  just come here a minute, i want to show you something.
why take the chance?  just let me go down there with you...
my employer wishes to remain anonymous.
mourning? who is dead, my lord?
fat sam left the beach today. so did gummy. it began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe i should be aware of.
stop this.  it's not true...
it was the fugitive in the chrysler that caused this.  we were trying to overtake him.
yes, i am.
i leave that in your hands.
yes.
i found them in your file box.
here's your twenty-five hundred, mr. brett.
maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but i am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  so back off or i'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  got me?
leo knew about it. tried to tell jimmy, get the warriors involved.
you do?
bret... what the fuck...?
look, man i'm sorry.  i know you got a thing for her.
that's swell!
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. his knowledge is probably limitless..
oh -- god -- oh --
don't fuck wit' me! don't fuck wit' me.  my lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in alaska, so dress warn.
where's the money?
i don't know what's keeping me.  i should've been here a long time ago. now how about my proposition?
what do you want?
i thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
do you remember me?
murdered...man?...
good. now i got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. r.l. and lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. what do you know how to make?
general mcaddie's.
put out a p.b.s.... or whatever it's called.
miss me, baby?
a bit unexpected, wasn't it?
what doing?
yes sir. right then it was.
holy shit! look at the size of that!
it's early.  why do we have to go home?
i am.
it really is lovely. it's in the bathroom.
we're doing it tonight.
mr. gray?
don't take that.  tell him to shut the fuck up.
they gone.
that's my cousin, angelo.
no.  jp.  my last boyfriend?  he like owns the club.  you know?  you were there?  he bought the statue.
this one's a story, but i'm not going to tell you what it is. every time i tell you anything it goes haywire.
dear god.  where are we, lieutenant?
you certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  you've killed an icon, for god's sake.
listen, i'm sorry, but i'm running late.
we get the games on the radio sometimes.
most people just want to make money or be famous or something. but you risk everything, just to help people.
no, i'll tell it to you! for the last time, i'll tell it to you. because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
i wrote him on monday. they found him dead on tuesday.
let's have you.
yet another spaghetti night.
hi.
they boys'll be glad.  we got a pool going on you.
i gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. and remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
you run with your back to the picture.  like you were trying to get away.  once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
i thought you'd like this.  best thing i ever did.  if you don't want to do it, don't...
that can't feel good.
bring something to drink.
you're twenty minutes late.
who knows?  maybe he's ordering army knives. i can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for fleming and marvosa.
five million dollars.
but you want days too.
you should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the lord.  we've got some food on the trees, thank the lord again.  and we've got rum, praise the lord.  we can stay alive a month, maybe more.  keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
i very seriously doubt it.  i don't think there is any possibility of making peace with england so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. that is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  with russia in the continental blockade, england must collapse.  more than 40% of her trade is with the continent and russia.
by giving liberty unto thine eyes; examine other beauties. why, romeo, art thou mad?
yeah, we have mr. morris levine's eightieth birthday party on riverside drive...or riverside memorial chapel, depending on his health.
was it a sudden quarrel?  had there been any trouble between you before?
miss ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
my, my... ah, who are you?
what's his problem?
get the contracts and i'm sure you'll do very well.  in fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  it was a "pleasure."
he won't tell us where it is. the powwow safe.
i saw her in the water.  beside me.  she was filling the bathtub.
not for years.
you're just on a higher plane, wilson.
aah, i wanted shari to come.
that man over there. he was in the hotel lobby.
no, this is the home of the oglala sioux and i want the dog-fucker who killed leo. whether you get him or i get him, i just want him. shit's been goin' on too long.
i can't... they don't operate that way...
i'm fine.  nothing's wrong.
you got the wrong man.
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-a battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to jfk.
yes. it's very pleasurable. but the jews are obsessed with it. you know why?
trychticholorate. then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder.
and?
captain, you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command.
nobody knows where he is.  we know he's all right, but that's all.
there may be things you'd rather not know about.
jill, say hello to felicia.
you're out of your mind.
i th-think i'm gonna like it here.
ha-ha... yeah...  what about that road back there, though? it says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
nothing! that's absurd. i heard you laughing and talking, she was asking questions.
you could have them here by daybreak.
where's israel?
it is very good -- there is no current -- it is very good. i have never seen one like it in all indochina. i was in paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
my husband tells me you're in sharks.
thirty years ago.  in residency.  i passed out.  you?
i wondered about your different accents.  i'm still wondering about your names -- rand and holland.
are you gonna steal my shoes now?
round about, yeah.
hi.
wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
oh, don't be a doo-doo.
get this.  we ain't partners. we ain't brothers.  we ain't friends. i'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until ganz is locked up or dead.  and if ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
no. women're always followin' me 'round.
let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
can we phone them in, paul?
you've got a point there.
and this is...  ...clark.  my friend is around here somewhere, i'll just look for...
...what the fuck is this...?
hello, guys.
no. can't say that i have, richard. richard do you know why i'm here?
hey! turn that float around. you think a swan's gonna swim ass first up main street?
i want to give you an oscar.
i'm sorry.
you know what? i don't take it back.
benjamin braddock.
the most wonderful thing happened -
really?  what did white say?
right. tell you what -- have you caviar?
who's going to buy me a beer?
two weeks and three days.
my mind plays tricks on me. is it okay if i take a bath now?
unreal, this guys jacket too. wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- a paternity suit... i just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
i'm getting excited just thinking about it.  what if he's not there?
hi.
i was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. and then throw him in the can.
mr. eddy's called every day... can i call him to come in?
doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  the feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  take you all away?
yes?
oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when i wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
let me tell you "scary," amber. look at me. do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? i'm a "lifer" here. best i can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
he's never finished one yet. he has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
equipment?
i was looking through scooby's sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests. guess what score i got?
what do you mean?  you gambled it?
-- you lose either way, price --
you were supposed to be here at three.
i was at hand.
how did they die?  was there an investigation?
sounds like they knew you.
how old are you now, toby?
you okay?
hmmmm.....
what?
the spiral begins in the west.
mother killed the father, then killed herself.  crime of passion.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." and then the mama bear said, "oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" and then the big papa bear, he roared, "and somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
have you heard of jonas salk?
what are you doing, ted?
mel gordon.
the lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
you've taken some strange journeys in your life.
like what?
right.  oh, and here.
you want to try with me?
my legacy.
wilson.
regula is class "d'. it consists of various remarkable ores. essentially, a great rock in space.
what's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
the omega 13... why does that sound so familiar?...
i just wish he never brought it up. ricky won't shut up about it.
who am i?
one at a time!  clear the air!  louise?  talk to me.  what do we have?
i gave her my word, warner.
are you going to see sam again?
because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
don't be so steely-eyed. it's that course you're taking in criminology.
what if i did take them? i'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
man don't know if he's been to mars or not
how long did you live here with your wife?
vaughn.
in a week.
... is that all you want...?  ... to watch me...?
they say it hit both sides of his brain... even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
so...if the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
hey, ray, goldmouth don't believe me. ain't it so they got trains up in new york city that run under the streets?
yeah. my brother art got his girlfriend one once.
how many times do you want to hear this?
what's it say?
mr. henry never gave you a test, did he?
and what's it like?
i'm only going to have you for two more years. if you decide not to go on to college--
barnes?
... my ... social situation?
first safety.
what are you doing?
he asked you, how far?!  i think you've been taking the scenic route.  how far from here?
i want to die...  no, i don't!
it's not the girl, jack.  sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  you may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
the crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. and the engines, admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. add to that, an untried captain...
i happen to work for the police god dammit!
what did i say?
but, wait, i-- you got me again. oh, and austin--
can't a boy be a dorrit?
hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
why the beach?
do you mind if i smoke, mr. garrison?
oooh, this smells terrible.
he's got you on qantas flight 2735.  it's going to be delayed.
because of your father. the way what his sins shaped you.
follow orders. do whatever they say.
"our" crow...?
just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
show me some respect, you little asshole. it's special officer tannen to you.
never
it's not something for nothing, george, i took you in on this, you have to go.  that's your thing. i've made the deal with graff.  i can't go.  i can't go in, i've spoken on this too much.  i've got a big mouth.  "the fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
what if he wants to get out?
i kept looking back, like you taught me.  i didn't see anyone.
this piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  do you believe that? isn't that right, tran?  you pinhead.
she'll need both of us.
sit down.  your aunt connie and i waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
you did that?
you're full of ifs.
araby?
i'll take care of my end.
he already had a balance of $600,000.
i'm not sure, yet... i graduated last spring.
you told me to look, so i looked.
neither are you, magnum p.i.
it's not your taste.
what?
would you?
oh --
god exists because you're horny.
excuse me ... are you talking about recognizing china, mr. president? that would cost us our strongest support.
look, i must have pupils. without pupils i can't manage.
oh -- great.
what's that?
what?  what did he say?
it's strange, though, isn't it? looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
...her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
go on, you're tired.
when they realise i’m missing...
none.  but his dad gave me fifty grand.
yeah. that fernet tastes like tar. my grandfather tried to give me that.
let's not say anything to my mother about this, mr. carpenter.
do something for me.
no. we won't. i have climbed it a time or two before, and i know all the places to step. just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. if you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
where's john?
can you even imagine?  who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
hm.
you look like mush mouth from fat albert.
if you ask us, no. if you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
you fired that shot, didn't you?
i thought sonny was the good guy.
rose, nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
sorry, i wouldn't have made a joke if --
richard stensland.
am i to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  mister harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
oh, i'm just not lucky harry.
ahem.
cool. so you're living up north?
she going to be all right, doc?
yeah.
no. seventy-five -- seventy-five.
how'd you get the picture?
you have to think about this, sal. listen to me, sal! you have to think about this.
my home number's on the back...
yeah. i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too.
isn't he dead?
he's made a few changes.
for the dupont chair.  i swear.  i'm becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst.
what're you doing?
i've never found someone really that i think i would like to go out with.
how did you get this?
don't talk about what you don't know. besides, she's too young for "the changes."
you idiot!
but first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
hmm. how about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
something else.
what'm i supposed to tell mama?
yes.  we would!
one box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  it's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  now she has to travel all the way to balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
the ship will sink.
you just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  he made a big settlement on you.
halfway where? you've gotta come home. we've been worried sick about you. are you alright?
a tape from the surveillance camera at the first national bank.  it was robbed this morning.
don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
you mean...
hey, listen, i love her.  she's sophia's best friend.  i never said any of this, alright.  i'll deny it on the stand...  you guys are gonna have kids.  that is so great.  maybe that's what this is all about.  maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  you know adults don't do this for a living.  you guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  sophia knew that intuitively.  look at clair. clair's a mess.  make sure she gets the epidural.  forget that natural childbirth shit. everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "life is but a walking shadow.  a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." and speaking of me, the role of leo in your film?
he drove me mad!
you know the ten commandments?
i'm telling you. there's nothing in the world to worry about.
macey, i know you're tired, but can you drop me at the retinal fetish? it's on your way.
it's just an innocent question.  besides i just wanted to clarify your intentions.
a fin!
at a time like this that's all you can think to say? "gently?"
mother and son. you arranged this...?
bill mayhew! some help! the guy's a souse!
i'll put it in paul's room, where it belongs.
yeeaoowww!!
do you like pink?
just get out, didja?
i don't work with spooks.  not after that op in cambodia.
colonel greenhill's compliments, sir. the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field, fully armed and...
why are you working today?
they hired you.  you're like, a private detective?
when's the arraignment?
no.
you were a roadie for motley crue?
winner six!
i think you must have an idea. they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
you ain't from oz.  oz is in that movie.
parking tickets ? that's it ?
oh my god, i've dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl.
this is wednesday.
asteroids!  chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
that's not what i mean.  gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
so what's the scenario?  am i saving a princess?  fighting zombies?
oh, good lord. are those neptunes?
could i do that later?
damn, i shoulda let spanky johnson drown you in the river when i had the chance.
eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
i don't think you'll grow careless.
well, i'm stuck with two and two—but i'm a sucker if i can make four out of it.  where do you come in?
what do you think?
what is it?
oh, no, actually. busy night.
it works.
you needn't be so frank with me about your work.
wayne---
i showed you all my conjuring tricks...
listen, scooter --
time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
i don't know exactly, jerome.
you never told us you grew up on a farm.
i don't mean to pry, but i've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. and i said it can't be true. paul sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
what was i saying?
and when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
they - that's bullshit. they don't operate anymore.
dad.
look, go home.  get some rest. take an aspirin.
ask me nicely.
people love you but i know you. jennifer forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. and doug hylton...
oh, you've been watching television.
what?
what we need is a space for real performance art. a cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
my what?
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
now this strawberry alice person, tell me again.
- so i watched europe. once you showed up in england..it was easy.
mr. concannon...?
she got a little poison oak and started screaming for assisted suicide.
and those stupid girls who hang out with them--
technically, they are still under the clemenza wing of the corleone family, now run by frankie pentangeli.  after clemenza died, the rosatos wanted territory of their own.  pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  i, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the tropicana matter, turned him down.  pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. i was lucky and he was stupid. i'll visit him soon.  the important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  this thing of ours, that we will build.
fine, fine. and you were...?
what?
aroused and inflamed.
...so?
let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the lord for all this--
all you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
no. but he must know. incidentally, my double left you with this.
what's up?
you have to put things in perspective.
well... it's possible they think my name's bobby.
that the old actress -- julia farren?
i was just kidding.
he's going to be our lawyer in vegas.  nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  no reflection on tom; that's the way i want it.  besides, if i ever need any advice, who's a better consigliere than my father.
i remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor annette married." except her brother. you treated me with respect.  look, you paid your dues. your slate is clean now.
yeah. all set. tomorrow morning. ten o'clock. room 211. barclay hotel on river street. oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, i'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
who?
were you looking? about the statue of liberty?
this is a club, sheriff--you been in here--
let's do it.
hey mav, this is sally. she doesn't believe a word i say. tell her i'm married, will you?
you've got to do something!
yeah! life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
herr falkstein!  did you inform frederick frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
sorry. i'm better with men.
come on, it's fun!
he has lots of disks.
my god...
thank you.
we're not going over there, right?
i don't know what to say to him.  i can't.
it's nine-thirty in the morning.
it broke my heart when harold died.
oh, it isn't like that.
grrrhmmnnnjkjmmmnn!
...so rich?
people can see this.
oh, yes. will you help me fold these, please?
do you have any theories about last night?
let's continue.
you mean tonight?
ray.  i hate ian.
what about thomas ripley?
tell egghead i said hi.  if you see him.
it's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
you ever think back to how you started.
and how does one go about getting these human documents, may i inquire?
what are you doing with my flowers?
this doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
answer affirmatively.  simply. keep those answers to three words. you weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  isn't that right?
how do you know?
you don’t know why he’s come to los angeles?  the man you say he killed? who was he? a colleague of his?
surgically attached.
do you have any idea what's involved? the paperwork alone?  forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  then the engineers show up.  they stand around and they argue about drainage - i'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, i've been through it, i know.
you took over for doctor yolander?
go away! you've spoilt it.
the...silver...mike...award!
you know, somebody tailin' ya.  a torpedo or somethin'.
were you going somewhere tonight, jeff?
tell him i will see him day after tomorrow.
if i don't 'grow up...'
he's dying.  and i can't deal with it.
maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. you can't trust anybody in this crazy world. say, i'll bet i could shoot you from here.
yeah, just an idea i had.
where?
you got your wish.
but you were pulling your hips last night.
not that.
wow!
they didn't find anything?  in the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  so, what do i do now?
hello.
wait in the hall!  i have to get dressed!
i'd say you already have.
hi, ted.
what?
you have a car?  so...  i don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
wil... data was down there.
...ah...
you just said there aren't any except on earth of the past.
i don't believe this.
what?  what can we do?
i can't see a bloody thing.
i know. we miss you too.
don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? a million dollars isn't that much money these days.
i need more pressure in the shark tank.
oh, that's terrible. i'm sorry. was he a good friend?
much have i traveled in realms of gold/ and many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ round many western islands have i been/ which bards in fealty to apollo hold/ oft of one wide expanse had i been told/ that deep-browed homer ruled as his demesne.
i'm here with jenny.
well, then, why don't we go dancing? i know a little road-house, down the coast -
uhh, no.
you must have some feeling.  some immediate impression.  a young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  and the things that went on in that house.  such wild sex.  what kind of picture does that paint?
h a r r y...
depend on it. no s. your subject is plural.
one move pardner, and you're a dead man.
hey, baby, that's good!  how'd we come out?
are you plumb crazy, man! what do you think happens? we're buried -- that's all.
yes.
eat a carrot.
skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
i'm sorry danny, but i'll have to give you the full tour later on.
mr. o'connor called.  there's a meeting with the revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
oh.  well.  i think that can be arranged.
can you help me get her back?
he don't want to talk?
i can't eat it with mustard.
that ain't no happy child.
miss daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
i've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, clive. i never want to leave the river again. the children have had such a wonderful summer.
you get a chance to use it?
a spider.  eight legs.
worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
so now i suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
no problem --
when did you get back?
has it been exposed to any sun before now?
how often do you test, director?
make that sixty and i'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
because my son is...  my son seems to be fond of you.  and i...  i'm not quite sure how i feel about it. i really don't know if i... like you or not.
don't know that it does.
i could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  you returned this westley to his ship?
they'll get us on accesory to murder.
where was this?
well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
totally. i'm fine. you want a beer, man -- ?
who's that?
damn it’s hot in here...
oh, i ain't doing that any more. i'm retired. i'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
they don't?
what's going on, tom?  what happened?
nothing...
society is falling apart, miss farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. you see, i view myself as the henry ford of motion picture industry, and i can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can i?
come on, sheriff. we've got to get bail.
we're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  we will never find the command nedry used.  he covered his tracks far too well, and i think it's obvious he's not coming back.  so shutting down the system - -
fine, dude.  as if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
they ort to. you're a good boy.
cute. no, 'cause no one's ever made it from atlanta to texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
where you going?
what's your name, lover.
something they can hold in their hands.
what do you mean by that?
looks like they can. what did they do?
i'm getting married...
what?
what is that?
what is this place?
begging the admiral's pardon: general order 15: 'no  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
i never signed the form.
maybe i should take a few days off. roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
not even close. hell, we can't even make syria or iraq.
listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
the character that's supposed to be me, susan alexander--
there's something wrong with this yogurt.
please let me know when you hear from daddy, get a number or something.
what does that mean?
is that what i said?
length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
i've run on. forgive me. we're here to talk about you.
yeah.
ah, yes, i forgot... god sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  do you think that god made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france?
was i?
ho, diplomatist!
i'm cold.
there was <u>no</u> cop involved.  oh shit!  fuck!
one hundred and five. carrot juice.  lot's of it. i swear, it's almost not worth it. i piss orange. oh, and i, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. but nobody wants to die, schwartz.
i came here to save you.
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
meet me at the tumbleweed diner.
it's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
do you understand?
our home, jim!  a kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
let me go.
the main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. this isn't gonna be easy.
i heard you've been having a little trouble with the congress.  theo pulls his eyes off sheila. kastle walks theo past pairs of bowlers.
pay no attention to me.
i know what i am.  i don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
where’s your follow through?  where’s your stance?
what did i say about mentioning that bitch?
to show them to the un, right?
why?
he made it, hunhh?
which one is your brother?
your honor, mr. roston lived with the defendant for many months.  i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson.
it's the patient's request, doctor.
i have to get my head back into my work.
courage is an emotion too, data.  now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
they said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
...does he know?
yesssss...
it runs in my veins, thicker than blood. i’m going to redraw the map. and when i am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
oh, we ride for a brand all right.  this brand.  how 'bout you?
what do you want to tell me?
so now i see where you're coming from.  just because we ain't rapping about gucci, timberland, rolex, benz, cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
so, it was your first time.
this is your largest payday ever -- how do you feel about it?
nothing.
i want to see him tomorrow, clyde.
where you been?
alex, you don't know how long i've waited for this.
have you talked to carlos about your concerns?
you even doubt it? i don't think we got set up, i know we got set up! i mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? one minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. i didn't hear any sirens. the alarm went off, okay. okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. all loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? those were the ones responding to the alarm. but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  you haven't thought about this?
oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
with a man in my head...
and a slice of pecan pie, right?
four.
what if your parents come home?
thanks for teaching me an important lesson. what makes a family is love, not blood.
is it ... is it, really?
mr. gower . . . mr. gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. it's just exactly what i wanted.
there's only one way to be positive.  i need to see some droppings.  i have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
artemis? do you read me?
that'll teach you where to keep your hand.
but you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
who's sitting here?
it doesn't matter now.  we've just got to be the first ones there.  get everybody up.  i want them all activated.
like a used car salesman.
shall i send for coffee? sorry i'm late.
cold!  cold and dead!
take care of mr. whale like he was your flesh and blood.
didn't i tell you, she dumped me monday night.
—and those and them.
we're going to have to do something about marla...
kinnear. cyril kinnear.  kinnear did it.
how's the mother?
not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
guess what?  luther just got in line.
no one came in or went out just like you said, mr. taransky.
i'm staying with the ship.  i'll be all right.  now hurry.
are you and mom home tonight?
will i still be able to play?
i, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
i never want to go through this again.
surprised i agreed to reed's proposal?
where are you going?... to montaldo's?
i'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
how did it go?
you saw it once. now you see it again. that's life, isn't it? and you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
doesn't matter.
reciprocity, mr. hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
what is that?
you're not going to faint.
probably hit by a car. hard to see things in the twilight.
nothing.
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang?
i'm aware of that. we don't have to turn this into a big deal.  okay? we don't have to have a fight. it was important to me. but forget it. just something i wanted to do for myself.
you promised to stay on the wagon.
i wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- i could go to jail.
i went camping once.  i love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
i'm serious.
ahhh!!!  i never heard of that term before.  i thought you were black of african-american.  no?
no shit.
oh. of course... sorry.
i'm not faking anything. i'm looking for some bath oil...
peerless, your father called.
maybe you're fooling yourself, ray. maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
you're a stuttering stanley!
this should cover it, auggie-doggie.
i can't just walk in and take my clothes off. it's embarrasskin.
i guess i'm just not a leader of men.
hi, snake. it's so great to meet you. my name's taslima. i'm a fan of yours.
that's the third time he's called today.
you think you could explain all this to me?
just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him einstein.
no!
bandit i, do you copy?
i'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. if you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
i'm going to ask you where the money is.  every time you don't give me an answer, i'm going to cut off one finger.
i don't... i can't believe it.  they killed him because he wanted to change things.  in our time - in our country?
come on, annie. bob and i have been planning on it all week.
yeah... just .... dr. scott's got 'im. you remember dr.scott.
no.
charlie?
weak sister.  i still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. y'know?
would you like your things now?
is there something i can do for you?
hasta siempre.
we'll miss you very much -- bobby and i.  he won't have anyone to play with.
what is it you want me to do?
i'm nina aron, adam.
i don't want a floor plan; i want to know who!  who's taking the ticket for this, johnny?
you wouldn't understand.  seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
you'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
no, you weren't
isn't this your vehicle?
you can hardly get your arms around me. how depressing. you're so early.
yes, sir.
his funeral - imagine it! the cathedral, all vienna sitting there. his coffin, mozart's little coffin in the middle. and suddenly in that silence, music. a divine music bursts out over them all, a great mass of death: requiem mass for wolfgang mozart, composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri. what sublimity! what depth! what passion in the music! salieri has been touched by god at last. and god, forced to listen. powerless - powerless to stop it. i at the end, for once, laughing at him. do you understand? do you?
no.
the empty shells are crushed and trampled.  the young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
of course. but since he is ill i'm taking the liberty of asking you.
no thanks.  i never touch french cigarettes.
the nite owl was solved, lieutenant.
yeah, but they're complaining.
waddaya getting so sore about?
what does that mean for evan?
no one i've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
senator paine will state it!
why, certainly. with your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
i mean, your amazement. i could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
for twelve francs, seventy-five.
isn't that what you want us to believe?  that we're completely defenseless?  that you know what's best?
oh my god, shut up!
no. i feel more like - yodeling.
just a bat! i'm fine! just a bat! sorry!
what are you talking about?
look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
mon dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
can i help you pack?
no, you've done a perfect job.
we gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
that's what i should do.  tell me why?
enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
alright dad. but you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the irs, and i'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
hemingway.  you?
now that was an experience. "you are only coming through in waves." that line blows my mind every time.
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
i'm sure you have
where did you get pilgrim from?
what was prison like?
[who killed her? you?]
dad...
why?
sleepy suddenly.
you're his keeper. if you don't mind him seeing you, i don't mind. but you're the only one he looks at.
oh, difficult, it's so difficult. you're a nice person, joe -- i should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. oh, how i loathe life. i loathe it. please go. please.
y'hear anything you'll let me know?
who's phone?
bet you ass...
thank you.
how many other silent partners are there, frank? donna?  little cindy? hell, let's give eddie a vote.
i don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
there's nothing i can say for one small child?
not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! where is he?
ucla? my cardigan sweater period.
you got a boyfriend?
oh, wow... i'll tell you what. when the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
no.
it smelled of the fire.
you'd slow us down and put margo in danger.
forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--it's an impulse...
what are you talking about?
crazy fucker.
got that desert yet. gotta take her tonight. take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
i finally found your da's army revolver, connor.
they are?  come on.
how the hell should i know?  i've never had a wife killed before.  i guess i should have hired a professional.
so like, yeah…i caved in. i mean, i had to. my parents, they're like …still really depressed about brady. so i wrote the bullshit essay. filled out the applications, did the interviews…y'know, i figure i can always drop out.
ah... yes... but, i didn't realize that --
no.
excellency, may i present my niece.
of course. let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- i'll get a job -- or, better still, i could get a place in rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
but it's comfortable.
ah! my dulcet darling. tonight we marry. tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
this is out life, alexander.  it's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
is it true, carter?  are you in hong kong right now?
what's your twenty?
why know?
what the bell happened?
so, no goat hooves, huh?
superconducting quantum interference device.  squid.  got it?  there's gonna be a test.
you don't believe me? well, i was working the weekend of the break-in and my god, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the fbi came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
well, perhaps i can't, plank, if you know what i mean.
what are the terms?
thanks for the help.
if i'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule i would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. narcissus, i should have adopted you years ago.  and now the gods are begging me to make you my son!
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
prouder still. you'll be the handsomest student there.
certainly not.
patrick bateman's office.
do we *have* to?
then where was it?  i'm sent out there... i'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
why'd you come here, brian?
up here, al.
do you know the velveteen rabbit?
no. really, i'm... i don't feel well. i've got terrible pms.
someone who follows his heart!
for not believing you.
anything today?
your brother, huh?
you didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
oh no?  smell this.
later for you, pal.
you are, you are my only connection to the world!
barton. are you all right?
not quite. this is my field.
it does help.  dorothy, you're waking up!
yeah, that's right.
was it bad news--the visit from peter?
pick a song, hawk.
i am, commander riker...  may i touch your hair?
do you agree with ben, mr. gardiner? are we finished? or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
why two?
the wolf's bloodline must be severed. the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
get out, will.
you're not tired of it?
don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. i've known you too long.
no way.  not dana.
the more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
i turn on the camera. you start talking.
don't do it.
lugosi's washed-up.  what else you got?
i had to scrap all my life. figured i might as well get paid for it. when i was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. charley and i was put in a place—they called it a children's home. some home! i run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  but what am i runnin' off at the mouth for? what do you care?
please, maya.  i'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
peanut butter and jelly.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "if this is the thermometer, then where'd i leave the pen?"  you're not... you don't think that's funny?  george, work with me, i always get a laugh with that one. look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
i can't! go back! i can't! go back! i can't! go back!
so if i ran now, there's no way i'd beat you, is there?
c'mon, norman.
my parents have money...

that's my capitalization on the annex! *my* operation, ed! christ almighty. that's what i was just talking to doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann.
i know you. how come you're so tense today?
every russian family has one..
you can't-.
so long, you guys.
what did you say... ?
sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
you dodged a bullet.
i know –– i know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
the financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
you know i get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  they think you went batshit!
i know, but you're broke. where are you?
the ladder?
van patten looks puffy. has he stopped working out?
well i guess the question is this: do you remember miss simms?
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
i gotta catch up with him, laurie!
or the f.b.i.?
i'm going to be number thirty-two, like magic.
well listen to me.  now, i know you like him, i know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  what are you going to talk about?  what do you have in common?  you're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.

different worlds, jack.
it's just there's so much to do in a single day.
why don't i escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'cause i'd be crazy to escape!  i'm all taken care of, see?  i've sent out word.
you're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.

tell him it hurt --
huh? oh, someone pulled a b&e on dr. gaskell's closet. and the dog's missing.
how old are you, captain?

i'm sorry, i didn't mean to shout...
i don't understand.
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
"by the light, by the light,
our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. they dusted everything.
i'm not hungry.
i know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. if you'll just be patient, i can work things out.
beverly, there were many reasons why you and i...
no!
i'm fine. life is funny, that's all.
i'm sorry. i'm really sorry... i was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  and then, i don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
my staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... i said that can't be the same edward dowd.
don't worry.  i'll do something.

they'll kill gina.
this isn't mike.  is this mike?
a tremor!
we got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
we've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. the way they can work together as a team.
you have no feelings for your niece?
what's your damage, heather? you ruined my...
jim...
the killer.
you'd better get a new alarm clock. the chief has been hollering for you.
come on! it's not that hard. all you need is one person. once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. everyone else will be too scared to question it.
that's i.a.'s pit bull.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
please, palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
we have no home.  we're vagrants.  n'each man's hand's against us.  we killed old shoe...  we killed the schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...where are you <u>going</u>...?
but what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
what's the matter with you?
you know how to use this?
god, viktor.  why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
this is a nightmare.  we should have kept him upstairs.
but have never been?
i'm sorry? i don't get it.
perfect.  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to --
i don't like her.
you're making fun of my family. you know there's nothing to steal from my mom and craig. you know exactly what you're saying.
so that explains his press notices. working both sides of the fence: jewboy henry, always trying to get his nobel prize, get laid ...
were it only that easy. i have obligations. the order needs to be filled...
did you read her mind ?
just sitting down to supper, jake. care to join us?
go now.  quell was wise. he knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
aren't you going to take the pills?  they'll knock that headache out.
is that a fact?
i just want to be clear about one thing.  i used to work for him, but now i work for you.  i'm not a partisan person, i'm an issue person. in the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  the most important of which, in my opinion, being mexico.  i know everybody that you're gonna meet. it's important that they like you. it's not important that they like me.  that's why i can help protect you.
where's the other half?
where'd it come from before that?
what about don?
calm down -- henri!  you must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what i tell you.  it's worth more money to you.
well tonight we're going to do something better. we're going to go trick-or-treating.
what night is it?
probably hear back from cnn first.
and like a fool i believe it.
yes?
yes.
cool off, we're seniors.
would you, shush?! these phones aren't secure!
i can't figure out why i went to utah for the morning.
you know, where i-i-i would get implanted from a-a donor.
beth?  now you've got beth killing people?
this is amazing!  your dream told you where this was?
virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. how did you know?
i'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
i asked for metal, you gave me glass.
any more announcements?
victor, victor frankenstein.
y'know something thelma--you are the typhoid mary of divorce. i mean it.  joanna and i never had any trouble until you and charley split up.
we might have; i don't remember. how many?
it's just...i've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
you think it's that good?
pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
my dear caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure england but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  he cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring england to her knees -- and i'm afraid that is what it has come to.
where are you? <b> int. chevy suburban -- next </b> claremont is behind the wheel of a black chevy suburban. he pulls into the texaco parking lot.

hey, i'm not stupid, y'know. they can't build anything like that yet.
tarazine?
hello?
penelope!
you got him too scared to peep, sheriff. maybe if you put that gun up--
sorry. my figures work out exactly the same as jim's. 256 for paul, 255 for tracy.
now why does she have to be naked? how does that serve the plot?
we was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
there's always a later plane.
i'm sorry, erin.
is this a religious thing?
you know what, mr. ... penguin-sir? i think perhaps i could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  and once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
why?
let's get out of here, elaine. let's go somewhere else.
come home with me.
why would he do that?  you didn't have anything to do with the accident.
i am.
wrong.  all we've got to worry about is ambrose.  nyah will take care of nyah.
in truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
it's a three-act story with a tragic end.
you were terrific.  and i kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
here's the story on that east 19th street murder spree. page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.

something real bad has happened and i can't tell you what, just that it's bad and i did it and i can't undo it.  can you help me?
tell me why he's dead.
okay...

yes?
you had a car full of stuff.  were you leaving?
yes.
shut up, before you lose them all!
oh.  well.  we don't really get along. paul and i.
now i'm nice? don't you know any other adjectives? there's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
what do you mean?
i'll take what's mine now.
i don't get it -- you said your mission was to kill him. let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. this  kurtz is ruining the war; i mean, this don't look good for america !
then it's over.
don't do anything, linda. i'd rather just forget about it. i don't even like the guy.
no. maybe. i don't know. i don't know what i'm going to do.
look, about the layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the buttle family.
i gotta go, baby. i love you. tell mommy i called. you be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
how was i?

did you see anything in the files?
what's that?
but you don't even know me. how can you care what i do with whom?
of course i'm not coming.  do i look like i'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  where is it?  the fucking bucktown pub?  ha!
it's been two days. you should call that girl nikki...
a good thrust, my friend. another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
i got fifty dollars to spend in your store, jesus of nazareth. can you help me or not?
that's as straight as i can put it. and don't tell me that i'm crazy 'cause i know i'm not. i'm goin' to hell. they're comin' after me.

i am with you, my love. like no other can ever be.
hello, bomb, are you with me?

why... yes.
i'm sorry.  it wasn't my intention.  but i had to see you.
no.  but i've been to brooklyn.
looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
so?
oooohhh! yeah! yeah!
nobody says you have to be like me.
there's a lot i can't tell you, tom. i know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  but it is because i do trust you that i've kept so much secret from you.  it's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that i can completely trust.  in time, you'll understand everything.

well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
where've you been?
well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
maybe it's all the pressure, jake. the money. things like that. or your wife.
it's nothing personal, george.  just business.
get way.  you'll see when i'm ready. first i want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how i lay awake at night worrying--

yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which i don't see how you could know about in such detail. how does lee know about these things?  how?  they're private!
'kay, place your bets.
steed, we really must be --
sure. if you like.
and didn't you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven?
we did.
what the hell are you doing?

i adore hearing thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  i'm so sorry.
i want to have a look around before i take you.

i am not third world ugly.  women like me, they think i'm cute.  like snoopy.

powell?  what's going on?
but you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
do you want to fuck now?
did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
here, are you always this sarky?
in a way, yes.  your fate is inexorably connected to them.
this isn't a virus. it's a worm!
this sofa is a lethal weapon.  the springs... are... the springs... what...?
i like it.

father, i saw a post rider at the house.
yeah. everybody's talkin' about it. they're makin' a big deal out of it.
i loved you. i loved --
i wouldn't worry about it. you've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
you manifested that, beth.
well then i guess i can skip it. heavens to betsy, wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
i don't know.
what for?  we've got a job to finish ...why are you making the monitor?
well then, perhaps you also ---
don't forget the south, sir, the west. filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  there's more of 'em with you than against you.  not like these mudmutts.
the law forbids it.
how old are you?
which one?
come on, george, let's hurry.
i never touched her.
this is preposterous!  i demand an explanation.
i don't think so!  just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood?
stay near the house, for christ's sake- someone's killing people. i have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
which means that she spent her last christmas with you.
out directing the search for the traitors.
i knew that after the fact.

ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. who else could have thought of this aquarium?

you could use the grade, huh?
you said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
hey, where's the fire, sister?
never.
i'm sorry.  i'm just --
how do you know that?
shut up, tod!  be serious!
oh, ted i'm so sorry to hear that.
what do you call a blind dinosaur?
rob's?
if you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
i just wanted to call before you left.  i'm takin' all these job interviews. so i won't just be a construction worker.
hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.

don't be afraid.  you can tell me.
is that what you'd like me to do?
listen, i'm going to yell in a minute!
sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, charles.  you still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
oh right. well, i haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  not on "page six" at least.
all i need is the front money and a truck. i could be back in two, three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving.
it's vile!
if you'd gone with bob you'd probably be in weatherford by now. of course i'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
...and shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
why didn't you cremate him?!
eh, ringo, do you know what happened to me?
we made the date three months ago.

you must have drunk too much.
'cool?
congratulations. i heard about that.
well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
stop it!

sun rises at 5:52.
no, no. thank you.
it's coming.

yo, pal, what's with you -- the place ain't operatin'.
that's the craziest thing i ever heard. absolutely not.
he took the day off.
excellent.
it wouldn't matter except steve should be getting back pretty soon. it wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
what are you doing here?
what do we owe our governments? yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
well...yeah--
rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
uh-huh.

where did the sun go to, daddy?
locus! baby... i'm here!
we don't publish a record in the paper, i can tell you that.

why do i feel like i'm on a blind date?
tuttle! ... mumble!  you've had that scab tuttle here, haven't you?
if i don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
you okay, jerome?
come on, laura. i'm your best friend.
fuck!
but the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.

why would we want to do that, nell?
that you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
they're arachtoids, buckaroo, from planet 10!
oh, yes.  he's found peace.
how lucky's miss universe gotta be?
it's my wife.
he couldn't look at me.  but i looked at him.  right at him.  his secret was mine now.  we used to share it.  but not anymore.  now, i owned it completely.
of course.  well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
morning.
i can't do it.
can i take him with me and have sex with his head?
wait!  wait!  let me ask you something.  if you like shot superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
well... i'm game.
someday, you'll regret my nature.
they're getting bigger.
you got something you want to do?
what happened?
kubelik -- with two k's.

you never learn, do you, gittes?
can we come in?
i have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
she's not at home?
why?
you've been with gray again.
well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps i think it's newsworthy.
ann, you always underestimate me.
we went out a few times. we didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
deal.
yeah. wouldn't be no picnic for you. i ain't exactly housebroken.
there might be something at j. walter thompson.  but...  ...i don't think they're really serious.  the position's been open for two months and...  they may just be on a fishing expedition.  i'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
better now than later.  we'll still be friends. i'm dying here.
we took all the chances. the money belongs to us, not him!
you are wonderful!
my goodness. a wedding.      my goodness.
what is it?
there goes the neighborhood.
48   continued:
gambling's not about money.
miss carnavon. gentlemen.

what time did you say they would be there?
i'm sorry, too. well, nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, ben, i want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
please.  filing a report will not help you find your car.
hello?
first i'll put your uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, i'm gonna add some downtown. they call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  first time shooting up?
oh.  why is it that you want to get into film financing?
i told you already: jennifer jenzen, executive v.p. of --
there's so much...
he'll have to run.

philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
son-of-a-bitch. you're some piece of work, aren't you?
well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  when we see them. meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
i forget.
it was windthorne. i knew it--what does that do to her love for ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place.  sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
oh, jesus ...
and what exactly do they intend to do?
sorry to here it.
i said i just wanted to talk to you...
don alonso de bobadilla.

i'm so glad you're here.

no, mr. lowery... but then she's always a bit late on monday mornings.
you saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
10,000 m.s.l., admiral.
hi, john.
he's drowning me!
so why didn't you kill me then?
you told me to change.
yes, monsieur?
if you are logical.
why wasn't i insulted?
they must have gotten it from the base. no one else would know it.
rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
you must eat lunch pretty early. it's only eleven o'clock.
you're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
saved me?  you don't even know me. you used me, caesar, just like i used you.  all part of the business.
at least mitchell stood up to it.
who cried that one?
yes.
it's not a hundred miles.  it's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  pure desert, mountains, a river.  if the map is even real.
try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the pottery hill. and a better jack. we planned badly.
no.  that's the reason they chose me -- i remember things.
it's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
i said how's it going?
i don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  she'd better be right.
constanzia.  we expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
you're in the wrong business, jack--you're sears-roebuck material!
he'll need a pretext.  he'll never figure one out for himself.
sometimes when i'm lonely.
that's right.
arlo.
routine.
it is, it is! hie hence, be gone, away.  o, now be gone. more light and light it grows.

i admire him. he's a force of nature.
i'm from all over.
you can't. do you know how many people i've brought into...the movement...?
he walked eighteen?!
can you swim?
where were you for the last hour? i've been lookin' for you?
oh no, i can't do it.
going to the coast was alan's idea. if he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
does he go down on you?
i've got the hang of the driving.  found this place all right.
what i did for fun for starters.  well, something i used to do...always was a lot of fun...  no, scratch that. let me think of something else. in fact, why don't we come back to that question. ask me something else.
speak to this lad, al, ... to mr. falco.
i don't know. this thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
oh my goodness.
miss scarlett.  in the broom closet.  with the radio.
ehh -- andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  the audiences don't work well for him.
i agree.
what happened to the lights?
save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
can i do it again tonight?
sssh!
no, they didn't say --
nell... please, nell... take a deep breath...
go back to 316, bobbie.  the sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'i don't know how i'll feel...'
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
i liked it very much mr. brock. i liked it very much.
gee, i haven't done this in years.
that's me.
oh god...
i see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. it's no life.  what sort of acting do you do?
he's an animal!
and you want a --
what the fuck are you doing here?
whoa... she is a killer.
you're such an asshole.
here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. he's not a bad egg. i'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. i got flagged for my blood pressure pills. the only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? well, the faa is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. i kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in cincinnati. and i was right.
no. headin' west. to can-tuck-ee.
what do you want from me?!  whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!
"god is great," yes?
you?
since grade school.
i have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. come if you want but i thought you wanted to see the forum...?
they could be utterly negligent. maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. have you considered that?
well, you're two up on me now. 
what the fuck is this?
the one who made you should have told you this. the one who left the old world for the new...
besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
i don't know very much about him.  except that i love him.
is that what i think it is?
well, i'm no aviation specialist. but i do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
she thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
good theory.  but i like my mother. i have no aversions to what she does.
what?
nice fellows.
i'd just like to have a word with her.
those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
let's put it this way, andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
no...
anything?
yeah.
i wasn't watching television.
did you hear what thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
twelve o'clock... yes...
you've programmed that from memory...?
sure.  just papers, photos.  stuff nobody'd ever want.
has he been prepped?
you shouldn't monkey with him.
charlie, i had a strange experience.  i went back to high school. and i spent a lot of time with you.  and you and walter and leon were singing "i wonder why".
well! you don't say!
do ya know him or don't ya?
every time i tell you that i love you, you flinch. but that's your problem.
the sins were used in medieval sermons. there were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
much too blue.
how should i take it?
say, you were pretty good. jumping in like that. got a brain, haven't you?
i'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  all right arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
"we"?  you and...
right.
yeah, well i don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. otherwise it's -
the body is a holy repository.
i refuse to be your slave.  i refuse --
that "thing" gets me excited.
he died in the bathroom.
no, you're not a guy.
<u>jake</u>...
its effect on the host has changed. the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. it's developed a way to modify the host body.
you're certain of that?
people change in relation to each other. love changes on its own.
no.  what's wrong with the front?
he will... come on, git down and act like a possum.
what would you call it?
i thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
i hope he fell off.
something's not right...
guilty on a reduced charge. hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. you seen it. plain filth.
what isn't wrong? why are you doing this anyway?
very outspoken, too. said i looked funny. wasn't that cute?
good job, not pretty, but good.
yeah, claire. she said she was fired. too bad, huh?
there are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. this is not a toy. i've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. worshipping, schwartz, worshipping properly.
break left! break left!   chaff! flares!
hong kong, mr. bond!
'fore i blow that bitch's brains out, i'll ask her.
keep it.
yes... lots of things!
well, you're perfect now.
did mr. marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness?
are you clean?
i see.  that reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
simple as that, eh?
who is speaking?
there wasn't anything like that. the police and the fbi people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  my husband... his heart broke when mary left...
yes, well...  i know my brother.
exactly. there'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. propane gas mostly. in small quantities it captures chlorine. protects the ozone layer. but it proved impractical. too bulky ...
miss sellers, do you know dr. alan paley?
hey, what's the matter?
my number's going to show up on his bill!
i questioned the maid, and she admitted charles had been madame bonaparte's lover for several months.
you have yourself a few flings this summer. i bet you're quite a ladies' man.
did you have lunch? kyo will fix you something.
if this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  where did he pick her up?
i hate that picture.
don't make so much out of it.  only reason i haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  believe me; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had.  i'm no better than anybody else.  i've just been busier.
what happened to your hand?
right. so we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. is that it?
oh -- careful, mr. preysing.
there is no scar. i'm telling you.
listen, what is this? what do you want?
hey, girls -- i was on television...
thirty -five years!
you are a monster, zorg!

i embroidered.
you hear all kinds of things.
what do you know about "the changes"?
we have to get through to the other side.  you up for it?
your brother was a client with our london branch.  we do a sort of informal scoring.  his numbers were outstanding.  sure you're not hungry at all... ? tung hoy, best in chinatown...
i say we off-load some of that gold now.
i didn't know what else to call you.
don't talk to them anymore.  sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to algeria - i'll write you from there.
every year?
dude is bugging.  transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
this is to be a very important picture.  i have written it myself.  took me years.
destroy the evidence huh.
big deal. we'll call right now and cancel your cards.
may i present her royal highness princess anastasia!
i don't know.
because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  because, god help you if something happens to that dog?
did you ask daddy to have the hat examined?
hi, welcome back to the 'world of the psychic,' i'm peter venkman and i'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, milton anglund.  milt, your new book is called the end of the world.  isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
the acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. you understand that don't you?
hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! it's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
i'm going to disappear. i die in a car crash in taiwan. very easy to do.
you really don't know who i am?
well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
what are you going to tell them?  that you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
will you take me?
there's a little museum here in town. they've hired me to run it, we've some interesting exhibits of indian arts and crafts. it's fun -- and i like living here in new mexico.
well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. i must say, professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
i'm the one... i never made it work. i just... it's not that i don't love you.  it's not that.  i just never thought i'd be thirty-six years old and i never thought... i don't know what i thought.  what do you want, darlin'.  what do you want me to do.
i'm exaggerating.
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  it didn't seem that long.
the longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this saturday, you just watch. we got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta el indio--

looks like we're it.
jammed--? by who? whom by?
from where you stand, maybe. but i'm standing over here now. i was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like pop and nolan an'... .
yes, it must be.
you got yourself a computer, alma.
what do you mean?
then tell me when the whales are leaving.
god, you're getting huge. how many months has it been now?
thanks. i'll be there. about seven-thirty?
what expenses?
no, i can't have that! they'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
really?
you're a son of a bitch.
yes, there are, aren't there.
what are you talking about?
what?
to us!
you're kidding --
how is eve? okay?
i want you to hang up the suit. and i want you to stay away from vicki.
--no--
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
it was to the same woman. i was just a kid...  it's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. something for you and me to talk about and think about. you know?
you look awful.
never mind. it's nothing.
did you work with him, keith?
and if we can't find him?
maybe he lives in this, this belvedere, ohio, too! maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-up and talk about the choir. but then -
rob here.
what are you doing on the reservation?
sounds high, doesn't it?
jesus christ, get a grip, louis.
yeah, baby.
vinkel...you've got quite a collection of er-collection.
you don't really believe something like that happened do you?
let me.
you don't have fifty foot of apartment!
where?
princess lili, godwin's daughter. she was with me when calamity struck, but after i could find no trace of her.
what would a law firm want from the new drug czar?
what was that?
cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
you see?  the tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  it's the essence of chaos.
a man? -- to switzerland? -- that must have been nice -- for him.
you tell me your name, i'll tell you mine.
... is to yourself. don't make me hurt you again...
oh no.
i thought we had separate rooms.
yellow pages?
start with the smallest weights. every week add a pound or two.
this the only spare?
i have to go.
that's not what you said. you said if you didn't have a winning record --
no.  it isn't ... she wouldn't ... it's like i must have done something wrong, you know?  freaked her out.  just fucked up something good again.
just a little.
how does mother know what i like to do?
who told you that?
well? what are you waiting for?
do you understand what i said?
it's going slow, sir. it'll be well into tomorrow.

i see you're still having problems with your openings.
head for... for the white water.
winifred.
yeah.
you okay ?
just think about one thing right now: what color?
i did?  huh!
why can't i drive home?  i will. you.  look at you.  <u>you</u> need a ride home.  and you don't even know it.
there's no right or wrong.  but if you don't give me an honest response, i can't help you.  i want to help you.  i want to know all about you.
hello.
no, you're his wife.
ooohhhhhh! i made it all up! i never saw beverly sutphin in my life!

frightening thought.

i don't know.
whee-uu!
i don't know what to tell you. i'm sorry. i made myself pretty clear i thought. he probably got busy and wasn't thinking. i know how that is. i used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
a fine trick! smart, aren't you? what a pack of lies you told us about those porters! of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. if they take us. but you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
he divorced his wife -- he married marylin -- he divorced marylin -- and he -- remarried his wife? what kind of sick --
i know how ta get him back if you want.
come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
no, no.  that is where you are wrong. for us, it is cheap.  in medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  in miami, we sell for sixty.
elroy.
hey, architect--she's joking. right, selina?  selina?
but you know my name -- it's dyle.
sorry, sandy.  i've got plans.
well, you have to expect some static. computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
i could never reach.
what's an audience going to tell you?
hello.
what brought this on?
fine by me.  we brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
has not, doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
you can go now.
ya know, i used to fuckin' hate airports.
help you clean up?
...against the computer.
yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
they did, did they?  since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
would you?  would you...?  or you're gonna what, fire me?
they arrived.
i'm sorry.
i've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  do you know who grandma death is?
was chancellor gorkon alive when you first examined him?
excuse me?
what do you want from me, jack?  name it.  you want money?
what?
do you really mean it?
that's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
about me?  how sweet.
so, jack... think you be a green man and not know gump.
what i've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  i wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like i said, the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix.
...just talking to you....
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to.
fundoscopic examination --
buffy, the ape-woman.
as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
i'm with dana barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
paul, what's your favorite fruit?
asta - don't bother mr. macaulay.
well, what do you know about that!
you called the cops on us?
come on, stand still.
you know, there's nothing you have to say.  because they know your heart.  you don't have t...
yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
you want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for captain naramunju.
you're right.  you don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  i just hope you understand you're among good people here.
tan? what tan? it faded on the airplane. i'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  two hundred dollars a night, for what?
what's debbie's blue book value right now?
there is the bathroom.  i put in soap and a toothbrush.
you have to keep him there.  do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  he could be very dangerous.
oh, well, i-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. w-w-w-we'll do it another time.
keep thinking.
quitter.
what's wrong with it?
you know why the grateful dead are always on tour?
had a seeing eye dog since she was eighteen .. didn't i tell you those dogs meant something ..
good luck, sebastian.
down the hatch - as we say at sea.
you can't tell this story.
this is samir.  see if you can guess his specialty.
as i was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
dad, adrian's got the whole city after me. he's always a step ahead. what am i gonna do?
dumbfuck glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, richard?
and what about daniel webster?
who told you that?
the wound is mortal.
yes.
more.
well, not me personally.
they shouldn't let people like you into space.
you're not doing shit.  you're so scared you can't even think.
there's a spider in my room.
i can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me jack.
i don't wanta fight you, i wanta thank you.  let's have a drink and forget this--
it's michael.  how are you, mom?
[don't lie to me.]
nor i. this is why i gave it to you.
where'd you find them?
the majority leader? right over there. and that's [           ] the minority leader. they're both pretty good in the clinches.
why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
"somebody's gonna die" by blitz. "bella lugosi's dead," bauhaus. it's got that creepy halloween feeling.
no -- not at all.
agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, jesus christ?
i'd like to offer my congratulations. that was a beautiful gesture of howard's.
when i have children, i hope i don't hide behind them.
just what you've published.
oh, no, no, no...  buzz, look!  an alien!
look lady, i don't have time for games. just put the....
christ, ted, i was only four towns away.
i can't do anything but i would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
what'd you do?  tail me from brentwood?
spock, we <u>were</u> its answer!
committed?
it was my mother's. she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school.
no, really?
thank you so much!
tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
we don't know that, do we?
it's all worked out. they'll lose tonight. then they'll lose tomorrow. i see it with stunning clarity.
he didn't mention her.
come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. project vulcan is about to begin. scott, are you coming?
they knew our level of development. if, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
really? huh, i thought for sure you'd say lynette fromme. she's got that snooty vibe i know you dig.
what about the gravimetric distortions? they'll tear us apart.
ben?
of course, the slaughtered lamb. why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
wasn't that general salazar?
same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. there sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
i said call them back.
who makes all these?
such as?
you're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
to earth. to offer testimony.
naw.  she won't call me.
yeah.  why else would he come back to australia?  if he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
the police have the poor unfortunate lad in the bridewell.
you four are going to have a little company out in the park.  spend a little time with our target audience. maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
thanks for clarifying that.
you work in a market, all right.
shrimp and fries.
maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
the guy with the transplant.
alchemy!  is the business term of the 90's, my man!  minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  i dumped some lira into research... shazam, we come across a diary by one of da vinci's apprentices detailing la machine de oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  money isn't everything, gold is.  fuck blue chip stocks!  fuck t-bills! fuck junk bonds!  i got the real deal!  money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting?
girls dig bateman. he's cq. you're total cq, bateman.
ain't gonna be callin' me boy when i blow your face off.
how may drops is this for you, lieutenant?
i can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
victim's a white female.
but 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. what do they mean?
that's your problem.
he depended on me.
did god ever make such a pitiful army?
ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  i mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. you won't be publishing.  you won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
yeah.
um... harry?  did i ever keep the books here?
i'm almost done, sir. you'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
whoo!
so i was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? i think roger could be the one.
i'm sorry, michael.  senator geary's here, and mr. and mrs. barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  won't you join us, mr. ola?
what's the fuss? i don't get it.
we think you should give up the magazine. sell it. let someone else run it. whatever it takes.
i'm a thief. sue me.
morton hull, the producer of 'this evening' just called.
alabama whitman. pleased to meet ya.
three minutes...i'm not back...no matter what...you go...
i know what's on my birth certificate.  you heard from daddy?
shoot.
and you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
but still died.
so you're grant's secretary?
he agreed it wasn't exactly news--
what?
i've got my duties to attend to.
what is this? this is water?
so it's off to london for a week?  new york for a month? l.a forever?
i'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
stay away!
chief, it's me. listen carefully. i need for the worldwide jewish media conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive jewish protagonist as its lead.
i'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
some more wine?
who got you into this?
from a -- girlfriend.
look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and i did and i started to like her, and then i realized i just couldn't in good conscience do it.
you'll have to find that out, won't you.
not now he doesn't.  this is my place.
you bought the new girdles a size smaller. i can feel it.
died there?  how?
you're australian?
did you get my card?
she was?
i'm not afraid of you. you haven't got a moustache!
how come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
i'll take my chances.
that's not bad.
well, let's call her up. what can we lose?
you okay?
who's coming for me?
you have to go to her, jonah. you have to find her.
so let me get this right. you were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the titanic?  that's great!
yes?
don't sweat it, man. i needed a kick in the ass. we're better friends for it.
you've got to get used to working christmas. people are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all christmasy.
thanks for the lift.
do you have a girlfriend?
promise?
what was it?
i do.
no romance, right?  that's why i came up with monica. it's what i prefer.
we're building up tourism, sam--
how much time do we have?
gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. if it's ragged, it was picked too soon. won't ever be ripe.  second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  at the edges.  and last, but not very far from least...  you gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
you feelin' sick?
my father was.  he gave me many lessons about fire.  now it's my friend.
no--inexperienced--  a red-headed kid--homemade clothes--broadway was paradise--and a slot at the automat was a banquet.
why does it have to be goodbye?
you've been avoiding me.
yepper. and vice squad, and meltdown... whole slew of 'em. i was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. but: enter ed dillinger. another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. one night, our boy flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. a big blank. we now take you to three months later. ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, executive v.p.?
would you tell me if you had?
yes.
why? you act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
granger and pitts are already on it.
excellent, but that's where peter come in. 3jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. peter will simply escort molly to the villa. once she's in... case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
greg, it isn't a wild tale. it's true. if there were only some way --
will you be getting back together? when you quit hollywood, i mean.
carter...
wow.  there's the town.  and there's the air base.  this is a great hill.
but there is no front, charlie. there's a very doubtful civil war. besides, i don't want the job.
mm-hm.
here what comes?
well, don't ask me to.
like what?
sulu, what are you doing?
checked and locked, sir.
no, they don't say much. but carolyn's 16. she's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. if i leave what does that say to her?
forgive me, majesty. i'm a vulgar man. but i assure you, my music is not.
under article 184 of interstellar law, i place you both under arrest. you are charged with assassinating the chancellor of the high council.
i love you.
we're due to take off.
no, man. it wrinkles my shit. let's grab a fuckin beer --
let me go!  godammit, frank let go!
yeah.
it's no arsonist's daughter, but i guess you know that. it's a young man's book. it got me remembering how it felt to be young.
well listen, i know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
you can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land jack there in federal prison.  he can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months. they're been gone seven years.
and give you a good buzz.
you mind your own bussines.
you are a slave owner!  you have been illegally surveying lands beyond the ohio valley!  that land belongs to the natives!
you girls ready.
$247.
to be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
dumont... my user has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
feeling a little better, i see.
"authentic 50's diner"? since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
you've made a good life for yourself...
and you... are you not also afraid?
i think we should go inside. i have to have a talk with the cast. all of you.
i'm telling you now.
also a conductor. very brilliant. young. von der null called him 'the miracle von karajan'. furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army. the same thing happened to another critic. true or not, it's not such a bad idea. critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the russian front.  but if you really want to get furtwängler, ask him about herbert von karajan.
don't gas me, fink. if you're opinion mattered, then i guess i'd resign and let you run the the studio. it doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum. so let's put a stop to that rumor right now.
lester.
actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  there's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
yes, that's what i mean.
do you see the beast? have you got it in you sights?
does the chief of the canadas believe the english will keep the terms?
which one?
tell me about yourself.  what you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
you don't need to thank me.
few have survived it.
oh... we split up.
i want you to.
we have twelve vacancies. twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  they moved away the highway.
doubt it.  he's dead.  the look out's a cemetery.
cause i'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  a bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what i always say.
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
bullshit ... i don't walk to talk to you ...
the bigger man is driving our mercedes to the school.  rachel will recognize the car.  she'll get right in.
yes, i’m fine.  it’s just this god awful football phone!  who has a phone like this anyway?!
says you were constantly calling me a slob.  it's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. don't you think?
he saw her at the northern care...
that's from the ... it's got to be from the...
...and awduhs a light lunch.
well, then i guess this is our first date... or our last. until now, i wasn't sure it was either.
this letter was addressed to superman care of me.
i'll regret it even more if i keep you on.
man, she's losing it...
nothin' much.
there's little chicks!  you want to see?
why wasn't i told?  any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  is that the best shot we can get?
tv, man! farrah fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
and what is ... this frozen moment?
hey, bud.
nikita?
well, she's got a point.
another bridesmaid?
you'll what ... ?
last guy i would have figured. but he's part of it.
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours. he's my pharmacist.
yes.
she needs an exorcist.  this isn't love.  this is sport-fucking.
don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
get him out of here!
i mean let's face it, mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- i'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
unless i miss my bet... my wife.
went over to philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
you leave me no choice.
hi, vicki.  you look beautiful.
then?
no, damn it, it's wrong, they're breakin' the law.
you want this ticket?
you ever think about running away?
a madman.  perhaps he was.  what kind of madman?  don't think!  answer.
it's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
do you believe in ghosts, nathan? because there's a ghost threatening us.
i don't think i will, rick.
he's not madison?
were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
we'll see if we can't make her well, alma, you and i.
what's going on?
but they would! don't you see?
are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
she's not in an ambulance father.
it's not about that job. i'm not saying you should work for the government. but, you could do anything you want. and there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. what do you want to do?
so you're the one leading the americans, i shoulda figured. so what's the scam? you get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
and this -- is the master bedroom.
no, no.  i-i-i understand completely. no problem.  y-you're busy.  i-i-i...
i’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, arn.
like you.
she'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
so what do we do?  do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
a -- a week.
i wish i knew.  you're hiding.
he's a twit!
thank you, nicky. cause now i'm gonna bust adrian's head wide open.
my father had farm land.  it was the only thing we owned of any value.
they skipped that step.
how much do you owe?
that's part of it.
daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
but why?
i hate to bust your bubble, but i wasn't defending you.
who did this?
that thing gives me the creeps.
ed!  what's with these revised pages?!  a scene in a smelting factory?  a buffalo stampede?? <u>three-hundred soldiers storming anzio</u> <u>beach</u>??!  what's going on here?  i can't afford to film this nonsense!
how did she meet him? did dad know? anything else in that envelope?
here, i'll take it. it's my job.
where's the rest of it?
sorry.
ain't no whisky, is they?
because if a supervisor knew i'd seen you and i hadn't reported it, i'd lose my job as well. and i can't afford that.
i been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  i been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
anything else, you old fossil?
i always had a bet down for you. you saw some money.
and he loves you back, doesn't he?
charlie, i swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
do the police want to arrest me?
nice car. how much did you pay for it?
no, no, i have to talk to you.
penguin? oh, cal! he is them.
oh, that's all.
yes, but we're just singing.
you can believe this, miguel. i'll kill you if you shoot. we must wait. i'll....i'll do it....i'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
mmmerrick.
reynolds got a doctor in. they forced me to take a dope test. it was positive. as you knew.
you think she's better than murdered man?
jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
you could start over again with cash like that.
what?
please, would i be this panicked if it was that simple?
who did it?
here's her driver's license.
do you want me to destroy this one, too? before it gestates?
i think you’d rather not know what i think.
right. sorry.
let's see.
he's in a meeting. could i have him--
jack, take it easy. she gave blood at school today. maybe she's just a little light—headed.
i see. and you are in california for what reason?
i was hoping you came to the door instead of him. it gets cold at night.
you sure this goes somewhere?
...in the morning.
what do you think?
how old are you?
you come stealee tleasoo?
she's in a great deal of pain.
totally!
suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  would you do it?
i don't know.  i don't see what this has to do with me.
we don't need the lantern.  the place has electricity.
i was the one who brought that money in...
frances, you're still filled with anxiety. you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. consequently, i didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
all back east.
we're losing it.
yeah.
bandit, i just thought i'd lay a smokey report on you.
no... where'd the tip come from?
look, i don't wanna waste your time so i'll eat while we talk. ya mind? *you* don't mind. so while i'm in town i'll be staying at the hotel metropole, the turandot suite. yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's ok though, i poked around. i'm having 'em hold it for me on account of i'll be back and forth. in addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. we'll talk about appeals if, as and when. for right now, has she confessed?
ed, come on. what's that gonna do? you're gonna bring blockbuster to their knees. let me recommend a movie to you. it's called "get your shit together before it's too late."
it was a ouija board, remember?
listen, ahh - -
norman?  where's norman?
i mean, the guy is history as far as i'm concerned. history.
then what are you getting so upset about?
well, i'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  c'mon, angel.
and the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
don't close the door.  don't turn out the hall light.
jon, i'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
you and your lucky geese.  you always see geese.
i can't. he didn't do anything. thanks to you.
what?
i read it in cosmopolitan.
thanks, i needed that.
what's that you're playing with, boy?
vaughn.
tommy tells me that capone's coming in from chicago.
what are you doing?
cab one, do you see it yet?
because they got wet.
a hundred and eighty fathoms! we can't be sinking that fast....
dead?
oh, you fuckers!  you fucking fuckers!  what?  what do you want?
sorry about all that...i'm your cit-- jasper.
so how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of batman?
hello - central services - i'm at 579b block l9, northwestern section d - that's exit 1 on green pastures highway at the orange blossom flyover - and i've got trouble with the air- conditioning
you better just kill me tyrone. and when huey gets out, when oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. i'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
i'm a toy to her.
well. i got an audition tomorrow.
what kind of things exactly?
can i borrow your towel for a minute?
why not?
i think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
never let go.
but walter--
oh, no. where will he go?
john... what's the matter? john... why are you upset?
well, that's dumb.
it was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
a monkey?
yeah, yeah, yeah, you. because in the dream... i break sinatra's glasses.
how you feeling, doc?
i'll wait for you...i'm proud of you. i'll <u>be</u> waiting.
he wants to meet you. he called last night and asked me to set it up. what do i tell him'
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
i'm sorry, dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "tina," it's seiko.
how did you know that?
there's so much, and so much of it is dull...
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too.
i could work the pit maybe, but i could never drive like dale ernhart--
don't worry, it's a long story, but i know who he is.  i know where to find him.
sorry.
put the fucking kettle down.
it was rio bravo. robert mitchum was the drunk in el dorado, dean martin in rio bravo, practically the same part. john wayne, he also did the same thing in both. he played john wayne.
the maid'll fix it in the morning.
boy...holly...holly.
jack?... jack?
we're cool.
the way you talk.  never heard a woman talk like that.
oh, just like the president.
how nice for lloyd. and how nice for eve. how nice for everybody.
i hit the lights and she freaks. turns out she thought i was brad michaelson.
neither do i.  a hundred bucks an hour though. that's pretty stiff.
you've gotta watch the store. i have to go to this.
is that the way it is?
be more specific.
mm. better.
yeah.
tir asleen.
that a new picture?
i take out the garbage.
what do you mean?
sorry...we don't even know if debbie 'n lucy are with this bunch...maybe they split up...
do you still think he's innocent?
she won't? why not?
we have just folded space from ix...
i'm not listening.
shut up!  both of you shut the hell up!
it's nothin' like that.
but what if something happens to you?
well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  how long till dawn?
but why, gray? why?
i think he's kind of cute.
emma, which is it--horace miller or henry hill?
it's just that darren and lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
"mocky-lock is the bogeyman, mocky-lock wants me where i am."
she loves me, thomas!
like what?
i was close once.  it just didn't happen.
eh, forget it.  what else is big?  teenagers!  jailbait pics!  yeah... you got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
that's good gin.
you heard me: leave the table!
you prefer women?
why? you can't even lift one.
mothballs, sir.
just cause i don't kiss her booty like you...
better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
masters of our own destiny.
and that's the best part.  "teacher-student relations: how close is too close?" we're gonna blow the lid off it!
i never said that i believed...
first contact...
jack.
would you remove your hat please?
you'd said something about proof...
uh, i think there's been a mistake. i didn't save that woman.
where's your dress?
who'd believe it but you?  i took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  even if they find him, what connects him with me?
a 4th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for chrissake!
i don't care whether it's important or not. you said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, i wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
i've never had anyone die before...  ...but i guess you get over it. i mean, eventually...
i don’t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
what's he doing daddy?
are you all right?
yeah. you?
what's this? what's this? god damn bullshit. bullshit. don't put those --
the people at the restaurant?
and i thought we were supposed to be going together.
i thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
you knew when you first saw me.  you knew it would be like this.
i am...you must know something about him....
already gone.
oh your a pilgrim all right. i saw it on your face back there in the dust. i saw it clear as breasts and blue suede shoes. would you like a drink? 
you wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. if i wasn't already the head of it, i'd want the same thing.
no.
i thought we'd be happy here.
monica and ryan.
have you talked to cotton?
do you want to stay here?
and put it through on a code red - i want it as soon as possible.
sweetie! oh, but we can't. it's business hours. i need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
harry chaplin. "cats in the cradle."
want to hear my favorite aria?
because you act like a pig.
i hear you talk when i'm waiting!!!
so sue me.
james...
are you alright?
i want my car.
detective bedsoe.
you've flipped your wig!
sons of bitches!
egypt?
answer the question!
i have.  spent six months in vienna with professor freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the mayo brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if i weren't such a coward, i'd kill myself.
want a metrix?
what do i do, evy!? what do i do!?
bastard! i will kill you.
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
what's in the satchel?
i think you're the devil.
i've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
what's the matter with you, lee? why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
who found him?
oh!
you tagging them...?
ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
this shit's sketchy. why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
so, edwin, baby, this is sunrise confession time... what have you got for us?
what is happening with the world? there was a time no civilian would touch a made man. now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. what did they take?
depends. you got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. now: who are you?
which couch?
carol!
the point is there's a certain art to the process. the point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
when might that be?
what makes you think i would do that?
hello?
she scares me. i scare me. and that girl in her house scares me.
a drought.  the lake was shrinking - -
yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
...headaches...you have that...i get such bad headaches...
chigurh. anton chigurh. you know how he found you?
you're alive! she didn't kill you!
okay.  so he was tall?
this is intense! and it happens every day? sometimes twice? i gotta tip my hat to you people!
tea?
no, i'm not saying her. i'm just saying, i don't know.
me?
well, i think it's good to keep all your options open. you can always enroll for the winter quarter.  you could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
"hey, yourself."
can i ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
yeah, well, it's not a point of view that a.t.f. shares. once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. you are now officially out of trouble. don't do nothing stupid, now.
that's their position?  you've certainly got them surrounded.  i suppose they've neutralized all communications here.
why don't you ask him first?  maybe he'll say yes.
you're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
you’re out of your mind. what’s the idea?
am i... am i dead?
tomorrow, i start looking for our house... you love me?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
it's too perilous.
why can't i stay with you?
you're just foolin'! my name's pearl.
daddy, i don't want to get into anything with you tonight. i'm tired and i...
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
back off, man.
i made a mistake.
would you like a drink?
h'm, i'm sorry, i can't go through with this, because it-i can't get it off my mind, allison... it's obsessing me!
i... i just hired these guys to watch my back...
well... i don't know if i have or not.
tell ya bri., i'm still a little sleepy,... think adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
he came to see you yesterday. right before he got tagged.  what did you talk about?
that took some fun out of --
didn't you hear me, grandpa? or you got your hearing aid turned down?
a tooth?
all right! you go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
something happened to them, mon.
how's verdell doing?
so the wiretaps we conducted on serna and padiche, the mention of israel's heart?
i don't know. maybe i should grab my mace. i'm a civil attorney. i have little experience with "the criminal mind."
--there's that word again.  i have a feeling this man doesn't play the odds, detective.  not exactly a slave to probability.  is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
you got the 400 grand yet?
he was with gruner!
what do you want? you must desire it for me to weave it.
you were just curious?
hell yeah! i been with...  uh, not exactly. it's just, i don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
what if we were to put bruce into the park as a guest ?
i'm not sure i want anything from you. you might want something from me.
michael!  this thing working?
neil, do you mind?
this is my city. i'm a cop. i'll find Œem.
thirty-one linked dishes.  you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
what?  right.  so let's start counting.
well, what's wrong with it?
not from me, you piece of shit. there is no immunity from me. you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. every criminal i have put in prison,
now what?
my father didn't die in a fire?
that's some big secret you been carryin', sailor.
where are we?
it's so cold.
all right, austin, i think you should go.
does this mean i can stop worrying? where'd we put him?
the ancient greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring vrykolaka --
"a faithful heart makes wishes come true."
can you just go off...?
yeah.
hear that?  talk to me, where are my detonators.  where are they or shall i shoot another one?  sooner or later...  ...i might get to someone you do care about.
it sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. i seen hundreds of them - all my life.
i don't think so.  is my assistant taken care of?
go to lunch, will you...
when i was a naive young recruit in spain, i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  i now understand: it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  to our women.
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  one who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
are you going to leave, too?
maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
i'm just going to my room.
okay. so we'll get what you want. what do you want?
what's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, ivan. you know anything about jamilla's grocery store?
what?
are you hit?
what's the matter with your voice, commander?
with a twist of my wrist ... you're turned over ...
incoming transmission from starfleet command. admiral hayes.
and you think we got a chance to find her?
some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
adamant?
what about the fellow in those pictures?
he'll, what else can i do with it all?
yeah.
no, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
you're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
goodnight shelly.
no, sir. and no federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
biting you?
that's ed.
mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
i don't think i'm gonna take it.
hey - you know somethin'?  it's getting lighter in here!
we ain't gettin' married with his ring!  you said you'd changed!
they are?
what you do is take vengeance! which is a sin against heaven!
well, bright eyes, is our throat feeling better?
oh, i see. i beg your pardon.
just come by to wish you luck.  need anything?
she wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
what is that... wailing?
-- just doing our job.
are you kidding? it's a dream job! i can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... god, i wish that was my job...
no... i can't!
can't do it.  now go back and get help!
why, everybody in mandrake falls in pixilated - except us.
look, sergeant i know i said some things last time that i shouldn't have said at all but...
yes, mr. poe? so?
you just wait until i finish here. i've got to dust these ships for your dad.
you should see the way he looks at you.  all sal wants to do is hide the salami.
we know why you're all steamed up, and so do gerald and sid.
what?
why don't you just shove it up your ass!  haw-haw!
he has a great body
they come here.  they all come here. how do they find me?
chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
disney! how inter...
that is an affirmative. i have victory dance. mmmmmmm.
i know, i know.
she's not available.
it's her room. she only got to the hotel this afternoon,. with him.  i guess he took too much for granted. here's the gun.
*you* find out, i can't.
ricky? ricky 'i lost the truck' ricky?
never will be much too soon.
he'll still be your son-in-law!
i'm not even good for me.
tunnel?
how 'bout christian dior?
can we go home soon rachel?
tick-tock...
i won't go, daddy! i won't go!
fine.  i was making time with your girl.  now i'm all scared, and i'll never make that mistake again.  now go away.
jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, jean d'aulon.  jean... i place her in your care.  find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
look at kenny rossi. isn't he dreamy? i wish he'd break up with arlene. she thinks she's so great.
how come you're not at sal's?
oh, shit.
you know what i want?  i want you both to be friends.  i know you both, respect you both. you should be friends.
you're in danger.  all of you.  i have no time to explain.
you left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
what's that?
senor, you need a doctor.
what the hell you thinking, girl? strolling in here this late?
-- that can't happen.  earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
sit. can you...  [the chair. have the chair.]
another rough night, huh?  that it?
jules, i want you to say hello to somebody...  i'm on with john - that guy i told you about.
you're not from beyond the valley.
it could be parasites, an infection...
how can you look at it so clinically?
i mean...where is everbody?
it's the kids, you know, not jeremy. he had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. he's always willing to pay. he's extremely generous.  i'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
got anyplace special in mind?
isn't it better like this...?
hey, girls.
if anything ever happens to me...
i took the early rounds.
i really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
al, what's wrong?  did something --  -- oh, god.  you're coming in!  that's it, isn't it?  christ, powell, i told you what you're dealing with here --
reverse undercover?  we supply to them?
your conclusion is premature. have you forgotten your scripture? the thirteenth scroll?  'and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
how did the fire fight end?
which one?
by freeing them.
you took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
what do you mean, general?
it's the big potato.
well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  you know, get all that city grit out of it.
where do i put ashore?
my dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
i'm curious.
the poor thing. six years?
her family? oh, they'll be all right. i'll bring them around.  gilded cage?!  besides, i'm not marrying her family. stew smith in a gilded cage! stew smith? ha!  that mug. what does he know?
it's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
...so then in '94 i went back to dade community college for a semester and when the wal-mart cashier job fell through i hooked up with the pizza barn.
here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
now lay back we need to do some tests and i have some questions...
mr. gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
there is?
thanks.
that was enough. do you mind handing me the ketchup?
no, no, i love that. i'd want it to be in german. i haven't done anything in german since seraglio.
outpost doesn't own em.
i know. i know.
no names, this is an open line!
she bit you?
why not? it's three am.
all week?
enjoy the day.
yes, aha.  a brass screw.
how does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
she'd get angry.
no you didn't!
you ready?
aside from everything else, your family all right?
he's captured non!
hydrophobia...
i-i-i-i c-c-c-came over s-s-s sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and i s-s-said, i said, 'c-c-c-celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
thank you. thank you. i...i knew you wouldn't leave me, grace.
uh-huh.
hit me with your best shot.
you're going to settle out of court?
look, mattie, i know you're-
no.
he is now.
i will go. but not you.
then find another theater
ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
what are we going to do!?
all right, so i made another deal.
i feel really good.
son of a bitch!
i sure hope this isn't permanent.
great game.
any trouble?
aw, come on. it will be fun.
ow!  watch where you're going!
yeah --
how?
here's that certified check, walter.  i drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 i'm a ruined man!
great.  they'll have a parade in your honor.  you'll be man of the year in seattle magazine.  tira misu.
in all these years... why couldn't i see how it wold turn out?
i've got a hot one.
what?
outside.
jesus! listen to this one: "do you remember me? airport shuttle, june 7th. you: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. i was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. am i crazy, or did we have a moment?"
[beat] so they say. [off becker's steady gaze] what?
not exactly. well, i mean, yes. yes and no.  hollis felt the public should own the water but i don't think my father felt that way.  actually, it was over the van der lip. the dam that broke.
now listen to me, pearl. you and me is runnin' off tonight.
listen to this bullshit.  "this is our world now. the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. we exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. you wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. yes, i am a criminal. my crime is that of curiosity. i am a hacker and this is my manifesto." huh, right, manifesto? "you may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
it's gorgeous!
hey--joe! where you going? we've got to celebrate tonight!
whatcha watchin'?
twenty thousand dollars.
if they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. first hint of that, they'll be on to the dss, 'this cunt's no trying' and your giro is fucking finished, right?
so, it's over?
three more, i figure.
red or white?
you will never touch her. you will never get near her.
restin' in our room. she ain't been feelin' well.
who?
now, jackie --
why does he always pick on me?
what's a revival tent?
you really do believe in destiny?
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
don't call me that.
don't know--just that she was afraid--
i'd feel like staying up all night! forever! or at least till i got the lay of the land, so to speak.
i knew you'd come. i left that skylight open for you.
i knew when i was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  i did my time, okay?  my sister, her ol' man's up in chino right now doin' eight years.
are we going to get the ball rolling?
you're not ready yet.  you still have much to learn.
i got the bat at home... on the wall.
what did he pay you, mimi, to stick to that story?
i wasn't expecting you.
ask them what the candles are for.
we can't do this alone.  we've got to get help.
it's not <i>exactly</i> him.
but he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested.
calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow.
how did you get off the island?
bu ... wh ... i ... i mean ...
you forgot this.
how do you do.  my name is penelope ryan.  this is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
barak is still strong in the north, and tendo holds the high passes. but the great desert forts have fallen.
are you all right?
it's cold out, too, isn't it?
what do you do for fun?
yikes -- i was hoping to wear this thing to the halford's friday.

nell, what happened?
thanks dear.
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman? he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park...?
yes, kip. short for kipling. named for the english writer of stories about india ... he bites into his pear ... memphis says nothing, waits ...
what kind of appreciation are we talking about?
he left.  i couldn't believe it-- he just left!  it's as if he's somewhere else... i'm only getting a piece of him.
pardon me, but why must i do you a favor?
yes. you're going to new york.
if you don't sleep, you don't dream. if you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
sit down.
come on back up here!
did you see this?  this is your more exotic dirty magazine.
you've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  i have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
john.  my name is john.
"old macdonald... had --"
i'm sorry.

loan shark -- hey?

to show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
don't worry, george. nothing's going to happen. i'll fall right into line. i'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. i'll be the best little foreign secretary we ever had, just because i haven't the nerve to be anything else.

you knew i didn't work here. you deliberately...
well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
i saw you on c-span. i've been looking for you for thirty years. then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.

ain't that a sad truth. remy martin?
ah, get with it, will ya, charlie?
hey, he's your roommate.
that's possible. sir august was convinced he'd met me before. but i'd never met him. another odd thing. when it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
and gaston, i was happier all day long. i felt i'd contributed something.
remember the first time we came up here?
you rigged the illusion to fail, right?
it does.
but what's our relationship?  are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
well, that changes everything. get the fuck away from me!!  i mean it!!
now everybody sit down.
oh, be still my heart.
you broke in my house and i have a witness to it.

she's such a long way home for you.
gimme western four-five-five-seven.

damn.

i am not!  fuck you!  theo's a genius.
preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time i've been looking for jake, this is only the second time i've even gotten a whiff of him.
n-no. he... he beat him up. he was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... ned just died.  little bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
no.
crash victim?
he's just waiting to take me.  when i sleep.
no, of course i'm gonna make the movie!  i've already preósold alabama and oklahoma.  those repressed okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  so we'll just make it without that she-male.  we'll fictitionalize it.
what? you've gotta be kidding!
that does it, swana.  now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
well, everything's set. creating quite a furor, too. great stunt king's going to pull.
where are you?
are you asking me if i’m gay for pay?
what do you want me to do, hot pants? beg?
i'm soaked.  oh great.
which of you dolls is daphne?
i'm sorry, sir, i'm engaged to be married.  my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man.

let's pretend.  you're the department of transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  fuel injectors that burn people alive.

what happened?
salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
well, of course not.  it's just that... you could have warned us.

you have a lot of brothers and sisters?
the w.c. fields fan club newsletter...  oh my god, the national psoriasis foundation!
i rent them. monthly lease, with an option to buy.

white russian, thanks.  how's the smut business, jackie?
this is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. this is a fight for tibet.

after their initial investment in the factory, grendel didn't need them.  told them to fuck off. they tried to get these c.d.s together in order to have proof of grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  now's the fun part...
please!
i'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but i have to go, robert...
'bout the same time i busted doucet i tried to nail this big-time dealer. i didn't have an id, but i was close. too close.  gained the confidence of a badass named dubbs.  he was going to turn me onto the big man.  he made me for a cop.  mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.

i don't want it.

i guess maybe i'm not as hard to see through as i think.  anyway, i never even answered his letter. maybe i should have.  i guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  he hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  of course, he built it for her -
jesus boyd you're going to o.d. him.
the fax machines.
now you're being rude, shorty.
you have such a head for knowing. you know everything.
what are you doing?
in nineteenth century france, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called sabots - into the gears to stop them. hence the word sabotage.

you reckless imbecile.  this place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
i found a way to re-route through the program.  i'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.

who tripped the alarm?
yes.  they're andy's toys.
it's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
i wouldn't go that far.
let us know as soon as you have anything.
it has its virtues.  it hasn't fallen down yet....
are you in a mood today baby? is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  talk to me, cause i don't understand these moods.
so, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
the police are waiting outside. they're going to take you somewhere safe.
that was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
michael you're trying to scare me...
i believe there's a rational explanation for everything. but i don't know what it is.
okay, good reason.  then what?
if i had seen a ghost at your age, i would have been frightened out of my wits.
how did brown & williamson know i spoke to you...?
i don't, that's all.
i'm not ready.
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
baby, i think about you a lot. i'm really sorry about everything. you have to believe me. i'm serious. i wish, y'know, that we were –
i don't mind waiting.
we can digest our-
...and that is what you need to expand.
fergus, i think you don't trust me.
...what did you do with the bodies?
all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
i just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.

you were late.
so, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
our guests are waiting.
how did they get in here?
we'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
no. but someday.
i don't...
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit?  perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
you're a bad, bad girl, stephanie.
people do amazing things when they're scared.
well, i'll come back later.
i've decided that if it is god, it's a sick god.  its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  it's created a situation without a goal, and i hate that.  a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  and us?  we would have to have "an arrangement".  an unspoken understanding that i am not human. how can i not hate something that does that?
wait you two. dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this. can you guess what it is ?
william f. kinderman. homicide.
you're hitting on me?
our pleasure, big dan.
cheer up, nigel. it's not the end of the world.
mr. clyde, i remember everything.

do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at purnell labs?
absolutely.  look at this.
tuesday at seven, at the hinkley firehouse.
see that patch of shirt? we wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. on a lucky shot we picked up some traces of trychticholorate. nobody around here had ever heard of it.
do you want breakfast?
i knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
some things must never change.
ted, you're not listening to me. it's over, finished.
what does it look like?
but boss, what about their parents?
no, chippewa falls.
ah... no one... i give it to copper when he needs it...
here?
don't you ever stop?
chow, chow, chow!  god damn it-- nutriment!
why?
my pleasure, sir.
i want to speak to dorothea.
fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
hey, rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
do not make light of it, rachel. they can do it... quick! like that! and then... then i can not sit at table with you. i can not take a thing from your hand. i... i can not go with you to meeting!  rachel, good rachel, you must not go too far! dear child!
oh, no, i can't let you get me that. that's too much.
what is it, betty?
never.
well, i'll get it from the safe.
your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
what are you smiling at?
father, lad.

most outlandish thing i ever heard tell.  don't seem right, somehow!
do you really think so?
geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
level ten.  that's where you've got to unlock arcade's heart using the keys you've found.

huh?
mommy!
greg.
well, here i am.  see?
-- because i go there all the time. i don't think i ever saw you before.
just so you know, jack -- i don't think you're that clever.  i think you're a fool.  a mortal fool.
say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
would they hurt her?
can't you feel it yet?  can't you feel that feeling... ?  you're not going to be a cop anymore.
what?
no. they put out two or three for every one i needed. when you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. if something feels wrong, you just pass it up. on one mission, i had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
wasn't enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  he got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  one trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  that came with her.
cooper. bobby cooper. oh you know, whatever pays best. little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .

why did you forget the tent check?
how long were you with the dog? alone, i mean?
what it's going to say on the jacobi film can is the same as it says on the leeds' film can: gateway lab, st. louis, missouri.
stop... just stop! that's what you said from the beginning. if i tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
you were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. i want to use a bomb.
wait! ...i respect what you said. but remember, these men have lands, castles. much to risk.
it'll just be me.
we better make it, or sport'll get mad. how do you want to make it?
i am usin' it, wyatt.  been wonderin' how the hell we got in this tangle.  you know they hit clum's house, too?  shot up his wife. his wife.  who ever heard of that?  men sneakin' around in the dark, back-shootin', scarin' women?  they're bugs, wyatt.  you know all your smart talk about live and let live?  ain't no live and let live with bugs.
when was that?
veronica.

you were late.
you're not?
hello?
sir... kay needed a sword. his was stolen. i saw excalibur, and... i took it.

it gives me headaches.
fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck frank sinatra, too.
what are your plans now, mr. chance?
so we can finally talk?
$2,400?!  are you out of your mind?
...they did it for a lark.
maybe martha moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
oh, we're good man.
i have a cb in my truck, we could get some help out here.
how'd you find this place?
come on, you guys!  the game's over!!
hurry, please.
shall we proceed?
we worked together on the inside. you were on my programming team --
her mother's dead.
i hit him from the floor with everything i knew!
your gun.
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  what is it, bob?!
what are you going to do?
this is all normal. don't worry. the abortion procedure... it affects you. it's the ether, too. it'll take a little time.
i'm on the scent.
she'll come back.
perfect. i'll be outta micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
what?
how ya doin'?
yes.
nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.

anything else, mr. black?  how about some water?
i think clinton is a breakthrough. shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald. is that right?  it proves he's a liar.  keep on it, bill. 
hey!  hey!  stop this jeep!  let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while i'm - hey!

we walked right passed him. he's following us.
so?
hey teach! this rock's starting to freeze! get your ass back hre!
assets are anything of value a company owns.  sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  by selling them off, i make a profit.

i met one last night ... all the money this side of peoria.
hello?
will you please come in?
you got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  i gotta watch you swimming back and forth on tv all night long, don't i? you got money for that, but you don't have my money?
a slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
i just told you. she called me.
why, uh, what makes you think that i --
... hey, somebody!  open up, it's me, macready...  ... come on, damn it... the towline snapped.  been crawling around like a seal out here...
did i ever tell you, i dislocated uncle merrill's arm?
yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
i went down to concord to check it out. the president is mel gordon. the vice-president and treasurer is gordon lariviere. those boys are buying up the mountain, wade. $364,000 this year. i believe that's out of lariviere's league.
i have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. industrial progress. great efficiency. your people are capable and courteous.
run, daniel!  get out of here!
i have the stuff from last year's...
the stuff we got last night.
and now i have "dociled" you, have i not?  by forcing your obedience.
not yet - though not soon enough for some people, i've already found. a death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.
well, i guess some people have it and some don't.
i gotta go meet kelly for a drink downstairs. she wants to talk about some photo thing.

can i save the sheep from going to the market? so they don't die.
were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
consider it.  meanwhile, dig up whatever dino velvet films you can. get receipts.  i'll call back.
no, who?
by the way - what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur, mister bond?
you didn't tell me. do you mean malahide's got...
i don't know... how it keeps on coming. it just keeps growing.
unsolved bombings in the last year... boston, new york, philadelphia... but no real match
that's the way to train 'em. looks like mrs. pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
either one.
yes?
the future of the common people.
... what do you make of all this?
they're from the dollar store. i'm not an idiot. besides we have a garden full of flowers.
yes... i am really nineteen.
why are you doing this?  you must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
fox hunting -- a stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
well, now, maybe you won't have to.
so why do you want to be a taxi driver?
what for?
so talk to us about something.
and when he came home.  did he write you about this?  or phone, perhaps.

jesus.
i should hope not!
what is it?

oh, i've got to find it.
i said sidney!...

but she didn't... did she. if anyone had seen what i'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. she doesn't deserve that.
intelligent question, nels.  i believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
you mean you don't want to go?
don't worry, mom. i know.
i know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
glad it's okay.
i been sendin' her money.
i'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
you had me scared on the phone.  what's wrong with the baby?
no -- you don't have to --
he cheats.
it was a machine, but it seems almost alive. like a... dance of light.  bud, you have to trust me... please.  i don't think they mean us harm.  i don't know how i know that, it's just a feeling.
then we could try something else.
i'll never understand your regard for them, charles.
then he's got to be a detective.
oooh, i love those.
you know where they picked me up! twelfth street!  i wasn't even near there!
any messages, carmen?
you know what, ace? i don't give a shit! i'm gettin' out of here.  i am.
but we can still do it, honey.
sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
sir, may i suggest --
the architect  his buildings are drippy. you know, like sand and castles. then i got this assignment. they want to start in two weeks.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
i've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  this man hadn't been dead an hour.  he wasn't killed last night.  he was killed today. in broad daylight.  that's no drunk- rolling job.
--mine's better--
jesus, mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
c'mon.  let's go to the ho---
how long's it been?
he can have my place. i don't want to go anyway.
nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  go after the people that knew kane well.  that manager of his - the little guy, bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  i don't mean go through the city directory, of course -
if you were the president, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
you know who?
am i in trouble, jimmy?
you're the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad.
his mother was killed before his eyes. that's what drove him insane. it'll work.
bitch! cunt! please, please, please don't do this, agent kulok. you need me.
how is dear old j.j. by the way?
it's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
the aquarium was swell. if i lived in new york, i'd go there every day. i'll bet you do.
are you sure?  about me, i mean?
my idea.  muchly.  my sketches. big heavy brow.  head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
look, faz, mr. kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  what was that he said...?
you like it?
i can't get over what those guys did to her. i just can't.
pankot isn't on the way to delhi.
i know why you're so secretive. why you won't let anybody near you.  i know what he did to you.
look, it smells good.  i'm sure it's delicious   but i don't know why we can't see yoda now.
before?!  eisenhower approved that?
i never been to a commune. i don't know. i saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
anything for art, eh, paul?
hello there, picart.
you sound like the media.
this is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
i just wanted to say thanks 'cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year.
that's why you got scared when mrs. christian hired me.  you knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  how'd you find me?
you smell like baby powder.
nobody can figure it out. and the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
certainly, but...
what do you mean, and be bored to death?
that was a footprint. i was standing inside a footprint.
what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you?
<u>charlie</u> <u>maccorry</u>!...you weren't fixin' to marry him??
what is it don't work out that way? where you gonna stay?
joey at cinema four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
you mean with the flowers...?
you listening to me?
yes, perfect.  as a matter of fact, i ran into simone on the lot the other day.
she's gone.
we're gonna get married.
now get on with it.
nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
let's have a rundown on the damage, lothar?
so?
you know i liked it better long.
no, it's still breathing.  kinda clammy though.  are you sure your stick's not broken.
i think we'll find what we're looking for at the cetacean institute in sausalito. two humpbacks called george and gracie.
yeah, that's how hams work.
my own kid was right in front of me and i didn't do a damn thing.
bravo, your majesty!
scooby?
you don't know what you done, taylor.
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is? what an important cause he's fighting for?
three, four days.
you're a cocksucker!
why else would she have flown in from newport? it's not like she'd fed ex a six carat diamond.
hey, i'm sorry, man.  i'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
there's a spider in the bathroom.
why don't you come down and get them so i can wring your pretty little neck?
she did not sue me. we had a dispute over money... i settled it, she dropped the complaint...  any other questions?
anything is possible.
what for?
so why are they after you?
what?
oh yes... very.
we'll take it slow. you'll never feel you can't handle it.
truly? do speak.
where are you going?
in the sight of god that is a sin.
i hope the men do.  i would rather the women didn't.
is she coming back?
where's mine?! where's my parachute?
which is ridiculous. boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
hey. slow down. what is it?
did jenny know?
you mean gandhi?
are you coming over tonight?
perfect.
i already told you, man.  corcoran.  know what that is?  state prison.
what am i wasting my time with this shit for?
oh my god!
what?
i know what ability you're interested in.
who the hell knows?  he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
where did you get that sweater?
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and i'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
that's right. but you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. and i'd like to have it!
i thought you had something planned.
are you pierce patchett?
nuwanda, what is going on?
what happened down there?
did these sticks make a whistling sound?
i'll consider it.
i'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
yeah, wasn't i?
five years.
you know the kids aren't really in danger.  this is about rachel, and you're right, i'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
if you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  i got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  good luck.
tonight?
sophie.
that's butterfield...
you all right?
what'll it be, sir?
melvin... i'd like to know exactly where we are going.
you saw him?
jake, i'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
we're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
you have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
it is dangerous to be here. the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
well, i would, you know, sam. it's just that... well, i need more than that. i need twenty-five thousand.
two...
you've got your ten levels, right? here they are...  each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  first one's the blood red sky, then you've got the blue desert, tower of ghosts, kingdom of the blind...  on each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  if you're too late, the screamer comes.
no no no, no no.
how do you know?
that's what i want to talk to you about?
i'm in a hurry.
yeah. fine, thank you.
and that's another thing.  you could lighten up a bit, yourself.  this severe routine is getting old.  smile once in a while.
no, are you kidding me, bob, not at all.
no. at chelsea childcare. okay. look, call me monday, hey? i'm late for work.
one week at the most!?
are you still going with that fella that teaches at grand valley?
why? you're never going to know.				  *
hey, baby mccaffrey. first one's the clincher. you did okay.
isn't that great?
have you completely lost your mind? so you get her out of here. so you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
in any case, you've got to recover chimera and bring it to us.
what's that supposed to mean?
now i'm late.  bye.
except for the hair color, she looks just like suzanne?
okay, ya know. okay.
excuse me, boys. i'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
wait!
how long has it been since you've been home.
two miles! minefields over there. do you know where this campground is or not?
hey, you know, what can i say, i dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
this is very awkward.
they don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
i know the facts, mr. kane.  and i happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  you're a man of great talents, mr. kane.
that was you guys, huh?
we'll try.
now here's the deal. now that i'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what i want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. see, frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. we'd never have a bad word between us. but since you do exist, if i'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. and my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. you're a weird little shit. i don't get you. so wake up. face what they call reality. we're gonna be a family now. and it's my family. i'll be payin' the bills so you got me. but i ain't your daddy. you just treat me like i am. i'm the boss, okay. and the other thing is your friend karl has to go. we can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. see?
who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
you're late.
i go with you --
reggie -- please believe me!
you think early's bad to me, don't you?
if you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
what elders?
cars don't explode that way. any simpleton knows that.
what for?
stupid yourself.
no.
trade, your excellency.  according to marco polo, the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world. even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
we'd gone to 'code blue,' we were administering electro...
why are there copies of the style section all over the place? do you have a dog? a chow or something?
it wasn't a bad bust.  he gave himself up because he knew i was gonna nab him.
chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
i always knew that you were special.
i... i don't know.  i don't know what you're askin' me.
now what?
and i think i'm going to.
she's not here, sam.
you remind me of me when i was...i guess i was never like you. so cute. so questioning.
seemed...on edge.
i get a's.  all a's.
it's been weeks since they spoke to me.  since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
hi.
are you sure williams is not all there?
it was such a long time ago.
pistols?
when was the last time?
why are you doing this...?  handing out these horrors! why...?!!
what'd you write?
selling all my baseball cards. and helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
how do i find them?  their offices are empty.
i am all right.
and, um ...i guess... i guess you and i, uh...
"big brother", "little brother"?
do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
my neck, dog.  that's the last bag?
you okay?
lila, what are you doing in there? i need to get ready for my date.
yes?
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   we were trying to restore her...
we'll never be the same.
and... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
look, listen to me.  a woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  i have been walking for three days!  i don't want to spell my name, i want you to give me this jeep!
you don't.
they left an hour ago, pink nuts.
nice friendly approach you've got. goble. i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning.
why didn't anybody tell me?!
does that mean you love me?
perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  when tutors answered every question except those about who i was.  when i was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, i knew there was something different about me.  but a king...
where're we taking him?
that's our case!
... i'm partial to the tight end.
bootleg copies of the frank capra classic, 'it's a wonderful life.'
going somewhere?
oh my poor baby.
what are we?
bunny, not you too?
where is he?
it serves you right. you cheatin' jerk.
i don't believe you.
an ice sculpture. it's venus - the goddess of love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
whoa.  no way.  you can't enter the kill zone.
they range up to three thousand.
meanwhile, what happens to the country?
the sawbones?
don't!
oh, fie.  what about the unicorn?
this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. you gotta ask yourself just one question. are you feelin' lucky?
let's go.
i didn't mean to be that rough.
you don't call, you don't write.
...protect your sources...! you screwed me! you sold me out!
claudia - don't -
<i>what happened to them?</i>
i know that.  what's it got to do with you?
did you sleep alright?
want to hear my philosophy? do it to him before he does it to you.
i have, master shakespeare.
i hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen beaners up to west virginia.
don't get me wrong. we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives. wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. but we're strictly hamburger guys. ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
the van garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  and the widow windsor was next...
i guess not.  okay.  you know, you're very lucky you're friends of barbie's. if you weren't, i'd never talk to you.
damn it, nuwanda.  you idiot.
now you're the one that's out of your mind.
this is tactically dangerous.
i'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
please —- i can't explain things like this to your right ear.
because it's true.
how does it?
i'm not the guy, harry.
i know.  they're more than a bit unusual. see, two years ago, pete got hodgkin's disease.  that's a kind of cancer --
those are suzie toller's teeth.
he will.  he has great faith.
what happened.... where are you taking him?
i give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
just listen to what miss gulch did to toto! she --
what the fuck does vietnam have to do with anything!  what the fuck were you talking about?!
fifteen minutes?
... terror.
this meeting is adjourned.
sit tight.  i'm on my way.
no gas... car dead.  we need gas. i don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
and, i'm unemployed. so i have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so i left them a message this morning. their expanded confidentiality agreement? i will sign it.
you couldn't believe it?  vince the prince?
yeah?  so you up for a game later?
if you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
here... here we are... here you are and here i am... feel it?
what kind of words?
yeah.
what's wrong?
would you care for a drink while you're waiting? i can put it on the underhill bill.
you wanna bet he's with a girl?
you must have been crazy.
"the worst i can do is starve to death." listen to you.
and roosters.
a little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  i'm gonna put your name up for membership.
i see.  that was an important list, wouldn't you say?  the people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  and you "lost" it?
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  they know where to come when they need us.  i realize this during the war...world war ii...vito genovese... during wwii he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
addison...
he's going to kill himself.  go skate out on the bike path! it's that way!
no! don't harm the vessel!
be here. in case.
you're a lying bastard!
let me tell you something. i know dean keaton. i've been investigating him for three years. the guy i know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. l.a.p.d. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
i can't imagine spending money on towels.
hey!  wow!
no... no...
affirmative.
you can till it with whatever you want. from illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
for me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? and you and anna... no, i guess they aren't like that any more. my god, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
i leave it to you, mr. deeds. can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
us. lead us not into...
i'm sorry. that was nasty.
i will.  see ya!
public enemy!  all i'm trying to do is cheer us up.  go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care.
pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
how'd they describe her?
that's all you've had all this time?

i can never get a way from it.
this town's full o' live ones.
pretty good, too. lots of detail. nothing hard core. old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
and he's never once attempted escape?
'm not worried about this kid.
new baby?
i couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
i'm in love with your daughter, and i'm taking her with me tonight.

am i one of that sort?
you okay?
laurie...
alex?
oh. our friend from the chinese restaurant. thanks, fran. we better keep it here.
who is he, joe?  i've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
pierce! that soldier requires immediate attention. i'm a surgeon and i know.
a blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
what?  what was that?
hicks, don't let him leave.
is there anything else?
who?
damn right i'm right.
dashes across the street.
well, good luck with the job.
what happened after that?
thanks. i'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.

couldn't get the last ones.  you?
i've taken the spear for a lot of people, sway. including you. can't we improvise a little here ... ?
right.  it's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
yes. oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. it would have healed without amputation.
how much do you owe me, curly?
what will this prove?
she's beautiful.
this is serious, son.  a man is dead.

inland.
d'you really wanna call?
yes?
i'm asking you to leave.
i'll do this for you.  fifteen thousand dollars.
because you clash, merrick.  you clash with everything.  i mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'slayers trained her.'  honestly, you look like something out of... pasadena.
he did the best way he knew how, junebug is stubborn just like you.
good.  good.  that's terrific...
well, uh... i'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!

i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer... sir.

where is he now?
the same thing as you. except, my reach isn't as long as yours. my father was a policemen, did you know that?
there are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the albatross.  i have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
why is she leaving me?
don't jake me, boy!  it's a big house.  odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  maybe with grace to keep you company.
i guess i'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
get this, man. i was at the game today. face to fucking face with strawberry! jesus! i saw him strikeout. and you know what? he looked at me, and i looked at him, and he laughed and i laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the big one. tomorrow. today i understood for the very first time that --
i'm michael.

no.
this is my home.
yes -- the merger must go through -- but i am used to making my deals on a solid basis. i am not a liar. i am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- i have a sense of honor -- i have nothing to conceal. i couldn't live happily otherwise.
we can't leave her out there. when the ship launches... she'll be killed.
it will do just fine.
people hate jews. do you agree?
but there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness i couldn't learn to understand.
aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can mona lisa?
ah, beautiful. just as he promised.
i can't hear him.
no?
we're not talking about any ordinary prisoner hoffman! we are talking about evil on two legs.
you are in the cage, o'neil.  right here, right now.
you don't like him, do you?
is this all we got left?
i'm sorry this came up.
i can't go any farther.
i checked your release date.  i never liked coincidences.
yes.
i just retired.
i didn't know we had sailboats.
i've found chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
all right. you win. let's forget it.
lobotomy!
little.
there's my little darling.  the night wouldn't be complete without you.
what the hell was that? who told you i was five-0?
look, mirtha.  she's walking.
not true. you're the only vernon i know. actually, i'm wrong. i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u.k.
did you? you thought you did. we've been gypsed, all our lives. look at your street.
look -- i gotta be clear with you. tony clifton is not andy kaufman.
the creed cat, that's right. bastard's name was "church".  let me guess. your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
yeah?
if you're hiding something... oh, oh, i'll have so much fun.
to customers approaching the bank from the rear
you can see for yourself.
lainey...
for evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore his forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
what did you think?
here. you shoot. i'll drive.
i didn't mean to get personal.
who is this man?
you know nothing about her!
i do know him...slightly.
great...
you showed up warner in class? you're supposed to be showing up sarah.
oh, yeah, yeah.  how old is she now?
i wish you'd get an answering machine.
corpses?
why?
no.
rick, i'm concerned.
that's preposterous --
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. we are in little danger of being left alone for long.  you'll need to do something. otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
"the female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." see i knew you never loved mark.
who are you?
old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! and a phobia against truth!
don’t stop asking questions, okay?
yes, i loved you.  i left the earth when i lost you.
i won first prize.
giulia...
would that work?
goebbels, yes, josef goebbels said, 'there's not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr. furtwängler has not intervened.' no, no one could have been less of a nazi than dr. furtwängler.
remember? "and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/and i'm lost in the window/i hide on the stairway/i hang in the curtain/i sleep in your hat..."  oh, shit. i'm so stupid. sorry.
later.
there is something evil about her.
as god is my witness, i have never done anything to that woman.
freak luck is a strange thing.
then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
see those guys?
brian.
how's that?
it's all here.
my tits?
mrs. foster -- send a memo to bartholomew at security recommending that --
i was it.
guess.
valentine's day.  that's got to be a bummer. where did you get that date, elaine?
you take care.
it's a long road that has no turning.
if it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
...i'm sorry, i'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and susan -- uh -- threw me.
i could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
what then?
lookit her bounce.
it's alright.
just as you say, hoffy. but wouldn't it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up?
spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
korea man is ok.  let's leave him alone.
here's the layout of the laundry room.
don't tip.
i'm a director sid, i direct. for example, angelina over there,  she's my partner. i can convince her to do anything.  we've been dating since i met her in woodsboro.
... and, principal collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year wednesdays are "south of the border" days. we'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
captain...  you wanna take'er up...?
deb... it's me.  i need you to step out front.
good night angel...
we can climb out.
smells like fish.
i don't mean to go on and on like this.
that could be anybody's.
oh, i know all that. sometimes i wish i was back in that garage...
who was the architect?
you're out of your mind!
what's ya sister like to do?
i wouldn't say that.
i'm not nervous.
claire, please don't...
i have my own business....i work. i work hard at doing my business.
you are birth of... what?  a phenomenon.  a miracle.  a new era in show business.  all i wanted to do was finish the film.
okay... so i'll see you tomorrow. let's not drag this out. we don't enjoy another that much.
maybe it's for the best…i mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…people who are bad should be killed. don't you think so?
i made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
i can do it myself.
no, evan. i don't know. it's been a long time. fill me in.
hold it, chief...
i didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
i'm coming...how close is it?
they think he's pixilated.
don't you think this is a bit premature? we don't have the backing yet to...
more clowning!  don't you see?
ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
yeah.  well -- see you, doc. 
yeah?
i might.
but -- are you sure?
one we're producing.
and how long have you been sleeping with mrs. windham?
what do you imagine you are louis?
a marlin, or a stingray. huh. don't ever tell me my business again. get back up on the bridge.
now here's what's goin' down. listen, 'cause i'm gonna say this but one time. on january first, the first day of the bicentennial i'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? a snow-white underdog. an' i'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? an' i'll tell you why, 'cause i'm sentimental -- an' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, apollo creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. now that's the way i see it an' that's the way i want it!!
maybe you better stay, then.
we need you, dr. loomis.
stephanie! stop!
at this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
the blood came from somewhere, peters...
but you're going through with it?
okay?!!
you and he are not doing things?
ed, this isn't the real world! you've surrounded yourself with weirdos!
what?
hello?
what works?
and now you have everything.
yeah, it's special. they don't make 'em like this anymore.
is that what you want me to be?
horrible accident. my neighbour... he got killed.
the gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
come on, let's go! let's get out of here!
i still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
what the hell you doin' back there?
didn't give us nothin' but his own name... ned roundtree.
singing?
well, you can...
if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
turn if off!
okay, look. i'm going to work really, really hard on this one. but, please stop with the pressure. i'm already tense as it is.
a elephant seal. where's mommy?
why didn't you tell bree, afterwards?
what?
i must have the breakdown now. where is berthier?
he's not at ground level.
i don't know.
i'm a practical woman mr. dulaney. killing andrew wasn't in my best interest.  as it is i'm out of a job and i'm not in his will.
so what are you bringing me?  looks like you got some film cans.
you've got to learn why things work on a starship.  it's coming through now, khan...
talk it through: childs, mueller, and nunez know they're going out on the regular tuesday night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: kill west, pin it on pike.
i'm out of here.  jenny.
what?
oh, man. i'd have to get into gary's house. to get the satellite positions.
don't panic...
cody! cody are you all right? mommy's coming! mommy's coming, baby! don't move! mommy's coming!
yeah.
don't worry, charles.  if god is still with her, she will be victorious.  we're not her judges... we're just spectators.  let her go to compiegne, as you let her go to orleans, and let god decide her fate.
you want to throw it all away, is that it? you had everything, little sister. beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. you were a movie star!
d'artagnan, arrest them all!
it's a peace rally.  the ctu's just opened fire on the crowd.
i said...
knock on wood.
go then. i can't let you put it in me now but i want you. i like you.
that's it, it's go time.
i was up here twice before. once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone. the last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
okay.
what?
denver control, this is flight two-zero- niner intersecting victor airway seven- niner-niner.
i guess inside. or he never made it. either way, i don't give a shit. let's get this over with.
hey, mr. d., what's happenin'?
alright.  look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  tell'em what they need to know.
but it could happen.
the question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
i can't. you're drunk.
john belushi... <u>jim</u> belushi...
the tide came in, the tide went out.  i survived.  that's the headline.  i survived.
this has nothing to do with him.
sull!  what the hell!
you on some kind of work plan?
i know.
leave me alone!
i'm not having some prattler going through my things.
thanks very much sam.
how's the case going?
it had the virtue of never having been tried.
well, i guess it's all good.
yeah, it's her job.
yeah.
positive.
a trip to the outer rings. whad'ya think of that ?
what the fuck is going on here?
no thanks.
i work alone.
don't touch me!
who?
no thanks.  some kid at the american express office.  are you living here?
then where is he? he's not in the hole. we looked.
yeah... sid?
we want to dust him. we truly want to dust him bad.
well i don't think i'm old enough and besides i don't want to have a baby.
mobbed up all the way.  tight with the dallas cops.  i'm digging, chief. i just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
his head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
okay, what do you give me?
again? johnny cammareri.
it's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  oh, you mean because i wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
what the hell?
he's gone. he stole the car.
no one saw me but the italian and a dog. i blew up their generator. they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
go ahead.  ladies first.
he's teaching environmental science, grant. probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
i know.  hold on.
there was this old man that ate his niece.
that hair will have to go.
if you want me to!
if you're not here for a 422 --
after dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
well, then cut it in half.
my face tell you all that?
how you doing, man?
it's a good day.  i feel good.
how?
women's room, stall two.  should we stop for ice-cream?
i'm sorry i thought you were the murderer, adam -- how did i know that he was as big a liar as you are?
that's smart.  let's talk about guns and violence.
god, how i have looked forward to this, honey.
that's enough.
you should be more careful, anna.
inspiring -- now what am i doing here?
bruce, really, when i say these things i don't mean to criticize you.
no, tell me what's so funny.
so?
never let the sun go down on an argument, jody used to say.
they just finished supper.
you have to go. you always did such, uh, you know, great work. i still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
a bit less florid, data.
things like the head counsel for pg&e calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  take it or leave it.
holly.
oh, stop worrying. he's all right.
we've got another one.
it's all right.
larry, you and your wife got problems?
maybe i'll do that.
yeah, i know. pour 'em short.
forget that ...
the law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
stopped they must be.  do you hear?  on this all depends.
gail. i hope this won't embarrass you in any way. i think underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
rocky's full of shit!  no way he's going to get nominated west of the hudson with a new wife.  he's gonna be drinking scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the republicans.
where is jacqueline gibson?
where do i meet you?
does it have a name?
mr. spicoli?
which cabin is rennie in, mr. mcculloch?
captain solo, sir. might i have a word with you?
maybe you should...
she's the best poker player you ever saw.  my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt.  finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night. he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  and he bluffs?  he had sixteen levels of bullshit.  her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. every saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. and i'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time i was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  that's why i'm such a good officer, i can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, i know just what cards to deal him.
i'm freezing my ass off.
there are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  are these your friends?
yeah, we did.  it was unleaded, high octane.
well, go get 'em, pops.
home sweet home! everything's fine, kids!
is that him?
didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  it was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  you ruined the lives of four people --
just lucky, admiral.
yeah.
alright, i admit it, you had me there. you're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
we're looking at all berlin outbound. good news is, every train station in berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. common feed.
we think the same way.
a blue shirt, perhaps?
that should make her happy.
who's he?
hello, billy.
yeah...are we going to do it or what? i still haven't packed.
what are you doing?
it's too late... we already tested it on organa major.  it appears your data never got through.
meaning me?
crafts.
go away.
passable, pimple, very passable.
from his landlord -- once a month.
and you didn't send her to a doctor.
asshole!? i'm not the rope-totin' charlie bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
birdy... i didn't mean to--
took it out the bathroom window. buried it in the woods.
i have too much money to work, mr lombard.
you wouldn't have said that before you met her.
shit, kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
i don't know how to thank you. mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
i'll rephrase the question.
i don't think you understand how i really feel about you, seymour.
who says that i'm protecting anyone?
why'd you get mixed up with them? you don't have to prove anything.
that's it. that's why i don't come to the goddamn reunions! becaue i can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! you think i'm a failure! i know who i am. i'm proud of who i am. and all of you, you think i'm some kind of pity case! you with your sycophant students following you around. and you goddamn medal!
hey, josie, hold on.  you've been hiding something from me.
yes.  he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect. it held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  it made no sense. but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
let's hope you're right!
stephen king supposedly used it when he was in high school.
i can't ...
why not, larry? we could get a positive confirmation that way.
i agree.
you don't even know jacqueline gibson.
after the show we should take a nice long vacation. maybe go to hawaii. that's what i'm gonna do. i'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. i wanna sing.
oh no... this is a battle of nerves between john and me.
no, of course not, she's a lady.
you don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
what's it going to be, elizabeth? seventy—five? eighty?
yeah, she must do all the flying around when i'm asleep.  harry dunne.
on the island.
you don't care enough about sam to --
no.
so far, ye-yes.
wow. that shirt is working hard.
did you hear what i said?
what if they're wrong?
i thought...i thought you might be able to help me.
number 17.
i'm a monster.  exactly.
you don't owe me that.
mr. president--
oh, miss price?
and how are we today?
you're making a big --
are you okay?
well ?
rob.
no, he's not dangerous. not physically.
if i pay homage to another's throne, then how am i a king?
i can't. they trust me, they accept me. i've got their confidence.
but you needed a drink first.
nobody move.
what difference does that make?  is dr. woodly going to be my father now?
yes.
lloyd, may i see you a minute?
what is it, mary?
hey, mister, you need a ride?
are you all there?
if you'd grant me a final favor, i'd like the chance to explain myself --
sara? hi. it's grady.
of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  this was an angry killing.
yeah?
250,000?
about the ship...
people think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. otherwise we wouldn't do it. after all, we're not fucking stupid. at least, we're not that fucking stupid. take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. when you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. when you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. got no money: can't get pished. got money: drinking too much. can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. got a bird: too much hassle. you have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
call and tell you.
meet my partner, gloria perez.
eight cops?  oh, great.  a jury's gonna love that.
right.
c'esc ma tete. this is my head
it's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
ni!
to kill. the taste of blood in your mouth.
well, there's a story behind all that. i'll tell you when i see you. by the way, i won't be alone. i'm bringing my wife with me.
we have to make it an early night.
you made a mistake, paul. you shouldn't have taken elton out.
why?
son. about rasputin --
that was our insurance company's recommendation.
if that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
"it's not me, beth.  it's not me.  it can't be.  i'm not doing anything." just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle.
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
i would prefer some peanut butter.
are you okay?
you want to give your child the best possible start.  believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  and keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. you could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
it's the kid's lucky day.
what's the matter? does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
i'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
this is no game.
where?
now tom, you simply cannot go to philadelphia tonight. that's all there is to it.
the girl needs help.
fo come ti pare. to desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
this food is excellent.
three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  now listen, i'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  spend it on drugs and i'll pull your hair out.
i figured, what's the point?  i knew i'd just be taking my problems with me.  once the kids came along, it made me look at seahaven with new eyes.  i realized, what the hell could be better than this?  i'm telling you.  what you really need is someone to carry on the "burbank" name.
well, i got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. and, i... i felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  i looked around, and i thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  how can a child grow up here?  so, that night, i told her i didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, i convinced her it was wrong.  i mean... i wore her down, slowly.
it was made clear.  anyway, stay ballsy.  first week's hell, then it levels out.  until s.e.r.e. training, anyway.  that's hell-and-a-half.
if you've already killed her that's fine.  i'll keep the bonds and the cash.  we got nothing to discuss.
so, i saw you put that book down your trousers.
when's your show?
mother....
gosh.  that's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  they certainly take their lives in their hands.  what with the weather and all.
excellent.
jennifer?
no, i ain't got you...
when you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
i trust you have been comfortable at shangri-la, since your arrival.
see? the princess is under there ...
fine.
they're not home yet.
hey, elaine.  you even know what he's saying half the time?
but, does it have to be an old mill?
he's headed towards the eastern most exit. do not, under any circumstances approach. i want to follow this all the way down to vig.
this whole place is ticking.  does it -- keep time?
your private train, sir.
i -- no, i --
no.
get up.
i'm sorry to come here, ms. grey.  i was afraid if i went to a hospital, they would...
kiss my booty.
yeah.
oh, i don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, i just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
the redistribution of wealth.
yeah?
oh, honey, i didn't mean to scare you.
i aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause i got it like dat.
well he's taken an interest!  that means he'll make your life hell, which i could care less about, but since i drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, i covered for you. told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. i told him it was great, so now my ass is on the line.  he wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
what?  what?  that boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
jesus, kayleigh, you're...  incredible.
that can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
give me your keys, don.
only in some ways. you're prettier...
it's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
joe -
-- listen: "november 5, 1980. cecil stipe walked into 5th precinct. says he witnessed chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in post. says shu kai kim wrong man."
...and who was benjamin franklin again?
go back to the m.e., take a look inside leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. trust me, there ain't chickens in the badlands. his mother's place is --
i knew him.
you didn't ask a question. you made a speech.
whatcha boys playin'?
yes.  initially.
we... won?!
so tell me, tell me, i'm peeing in my pants.
so you're going to michigan?
take your pen in hand, marquis. purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
what do you mean, no?
dr. venkman?  dana is not here.
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at doolan's farm, where mick the groom is breaking it in.  is that true, papa?
yeah. is it...
i could have stopped him.
if you knew, leon...!  i killed one thousand in my head...  and this never disturbed my sleep.
the hotel.
you mustn't take it so badly.
nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
how about in the forum.  right in front of the senate.
you mean like "time flies"?
what the fuck?
you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  very neat.  good morning, mrs. west.
mother and father know best.
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
why else would they approach us in this way? it's deniable. the soviets have done nothing but lie to us. this could be more of the same.
oh yeah?
i love my brothers.
who are these people?
well?
yes.
"thunder road," bruce springsteen, from born to run. "smells like teen spirit," nirvana, nevermind.
women are all you have on your mind!
so i noticed. never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
the point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. she got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and i think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
what's my name?
i know the owner of campton place.  i could talk to him in the morning.
i'm sorry, mr. basquiat.
who is it?
are they hookin' you up with a job?
she's going to wash your jeep?
sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  and second...
but i don't understand...
you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism.
my heart stays here.
so what's the deal?
my boss.
i don't.
i'll never get over it -- but i'll always remember him...
money problems?
did i say 'kidneys'? i meant my ear. maybe i should see an ear dahhh --  ever serve time?
what are you putting that crap on me for?
mrs. williams? thanks for the cake.
...with the affiliates.
maybe i can do something right.
which is the one - we have to worry about?
where's the other guy?  buzz.
int. tunnel - day.
what are you doing?
i don't know man. i don't know. that reminds me.  another little donation from the police.
thank you very much indeed.
the lifeline is divided that way.
probably not.
hell, no. i'm just a fella now. ain't no different from anyone else no more.
now you're talking!
don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when i bring him out.
so why does he call himself bertrand?
yeah, but it was shot.
he wants to kill us.
what do you mean?
put it in a cup of water. it's nutmeg.
before you go...
i just don't know if i should be dating anyone right now.
well, wait.  you know what?  i know.
jesus.  are you sure this is the street?
i get it.
you've never been alone and you can't be alone --
or hemingway, when hadley lost all those stories.
mr. stevens?
marvin says that rex's will is four years old. he never redrafted it.
hi. sarah knottingham.
now?
when're you going to see him again?
affirmative, admiral.
is that a threat?
is it frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
all right, settle down. all this money ain't ours.
you can't tell this story.  he's not kidding you.  you can't tell this story.  <u>you</u> knew that.  the pay off was, you get to be ambassador, or...
close call.  for the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. life's tenuous.
they're given to the living in memory of the dead.  if this is a real one -- i can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
i read the one about the penal colony.
why no. she's still on her date with biff ... is something the matter?
he won't go into the interrogation room.
yes, sir.
i'm sorry i went off like that, i get passionate. i--i guess i'm a passionate person. one of those things i had forgotten.  when you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
really?
one-hundred-thousand!?  that son-of-a-bitch.
not that far, only halfway.  you sure you know what you're doing?
figure it out.  you got plenty of time.
i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
wonderful!!... wonderful to see you, pete. how are you?
something like that.
john never said much about him.  he dies.  even before the war...
that's just so embarrassing.
apipoulai!
what john doe?
it's a swell idea, gallagher. how's this?  the wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. how's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
we're doomed.  goodbye, mistress leia.  goodbye, captain ...
you want me to go with you?  maybe i can help.
i can't believe what you're tellin' me.
<u>i trusted you</u>, riddick. goddamn, i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
well that's your call.  doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  just as long as i get my cut.
well... we'll see.
this looks done.
i am the mighty ape!
yeah. look at this polar bear. it hasn't moved in half an hour. and those eskimos over there...i'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
you oughtta read this hood, nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. check out the checkers speech stuff.
i want you to take this, lenny. today's your day of atonement. i know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
go onto the next question.
do you <u>know</u> king boris?
it's not that simple.  lyle, play the recording for dr. weir.
thank you ever so.
ah, good. new acquisitions. you are a protocol droid, are you not?
i don't know what that means.  what kind of problem?
has anyone been by? police? fbi?
what's the matter?
beats me!  what do you think?  smoking! heavy petting, without a chaperone. heavy petting, with the chaperone.  and wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  the demon bra.
you mean - like frigid?
yeah, i guess so.
no sir but you struck me as a man who wouldn't want to waste a chair. i remember dates. names. numbers. i saw him on november 28th.
listen, i'll never make it.  i'll have to go to the toilet.
i can get my butt kicked for this. you're not supposed to be in here.
yeah-well, i didn't start out spying. i-i thought i'd surprise yuh. pick you up after school.
aren't you suiting up, mate?
yeah.
how did he know?
want anything to drink?
i'm gonna get this developed and send it to the warren commission.
would you like to tell me?
peter valerian.
saw who!!?
i'll send wilson up to take you for x-rays, mr. gardiner. feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
boss, i got all the time you need.
henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  je vous présente mon associé, pierre nicoli.  henri devereaux.
well --
with all due respect, cynthia you're nuts. i'm giving him another month!
michelle cannot possibly accept!
it will be rough.
jimmy?  bushmills.   lookit, do me a favor.  i'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
oh, him. he has a cat of his own. but his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man i ever saw. goofy, if ya ast me.]
i only met him once, but that was enough.  for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  he offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  he claims to have some sort of factory in texas, i believe. said i could have the run of the place.  he had all sorts of specifications.  but when i questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  it's sad.  so few men do.
sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 ford roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
why not? now that they're kicking me upstairs --
i'll betcha! that's bullshit and i'll betcha! you're fulla shit!
yeah, but they're not watching yachts. come on - you're going to call osgood.
he's...i'm sorry...so sorry...i've seen this before, you know and you don't.... he's going very fast....frank...um....
well a lot of things cross my mind. i've always been a fast thinker, ev. i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
incredible... these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? this isn't some kind of hoax?
your majesty...?
up.
yeah?
i hate boats.
pa! shh!
if you don't have any questions, i'll let you get back to doing your job.
oh, i was gonna say ...
if you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
i eat. i just haven't had coffee yet.
okay, wade.  translators?
i'm not wearing a bra.
so?
what are you -- stupid?
being here, with me.
sounds boring.
what do you mean, no?
are we?
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. sometimes it's because of...
just hold on!
remember, mary, how he said it: "couldn't have done better myself, jabez stone," and it was my first speech. i don't know what came into me, mary. i just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
we know three things about man-eaters. first, they always return to where they've attacked before. second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. and third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
i think that's him.
you're being really immature.
i didn't say a word.
yeah, and gradually you get old and die. you know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
stanley, i heard all about it.
you know, sonny, i used to dope a lot, and i was into dipping?  and i did a couple bank jobs, and the lord jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
what?
but we can't allow them to be taken back to kronos as prisoners.
oh, how'd she get back?
he has a wife and kid.  that's how we'll get to him.
it wasn't a suicide attempt.  i regret ever saying that.
at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
boy, i can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
oh no. you had to marry him because you got pregnant?
hey that's great king, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em king... got your address right? you know where you can reach men, man. anytime!
you knew just what i was there for.
you're, you've, i mean, how have you bee--
hey kit, where do i go for the clothes?  good stuff on <u>him</u>.
please let me come with you. please please please...
i don't know.  sometime.  later. listen, rob, would you have sex with me?
i have no idea.
can we dream?
too much mayonnaise?
please!
not have it.
you?  what about me?  i’m working hard for you here, jack.  on christmas too!  now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  i was moved...
ha! did ya see that!  hey, cheswick!
you were. i have work to do. the publisher wants the transcripts by monday. go. make yourself at home.
don't go there...
what do you want?
each to his fate, lad.
now you stay put!
what was that?
you ready?
it's okay.
yeah? who is it?
i'm gale weathers, author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders, and anchorwoman for total entertainment. maybe you've heard of me?
oh my god.
let me talk to the lady again.
c'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
then what do you care?
probably mister riddle.
i just know, that's all. i remember you from central.
about things.  about your wife.
uh-huh. adam?
thank you, comrade.
what?
if you don't mind i think i'll stay at the hotel.
she said i haven't been the same since then. since that night. there's still this big hole in my brain. it's so dark in there, jake. and these creatures. it's like they're crawling out of my brain. what happened that night? why won't they tell us?
i'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch tv and go to bed.  then tomorrow i'll get up and go to work.
where are you going?
it's crazy.
then who flushed the toilet?
the air... the power.
don't do it.  please... don't go --
there you go.  grain of salt.  two sides to every coin.
well, if that's hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
i'm leaving now. i've assessed the situation and i'm going.
divorced.  remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in sausalito.
i said no touching.
no micheal did. it was an accident.
what's the problem? you don't like me -- don't like the turtles -- what is it?
all the suites are about the same.
a disorder of the nerves. at least we think it is. we don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. she shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
well, if you want my opinion...
i think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
where're we going?
well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
a father is nothing but sperm, ted. it takes a real man to be a dad.
whoa there...
trying to keep me away from you! it couldn't be done. naturally i couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but i found a way, didn't i? darling, i had to see you. i wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
you understand that we have lost all contact with captain kirk...?
what's with the friggin numbers?
eh?
you don't remember anything else?
you have an active imagination.
didn't mean to bum you out.
it was blown up with the plane.
hey, look.  you start paying, who knows what will happen.  you're a good father, george.  i always gave you that.  but you've got to talk to her.
i thought you might be able to make a connection.
nothing. look, i'll write it down for you, okay?
what'd you dream?
pal, my whole life's an emergency.
yeah, i guess we should.
we could have the whole left wing? wouldn't that be nice! would that be room enough for us?
i was just playing ball.
how should i know? "solving a problem," i guess. or needing to control everything. i don't know.  i've gotta get in there.
not like this... they don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  i never really noticed them much...
the green destiny sword?  you're giving it to sir te?
seven, eight.  so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what i'm doing, and i start trying to explain to her, about this state that i can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
we're gonna feature gale's cast more.  the trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. as long as we have gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  but if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
it sounds hysterical, but otis just rubbed up against me and i'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  you know it could be disaster.  he's so allergic.  it's terrifying.
no.  because the bus went off the road.  and crashed.
professor marvel never guesses -- he knows! now, why are you running away?
miriam called, looking for you. she said you might come, so i...
it's working.  the positive gev's are climbing.
forget it.  i'11 probably shit blood tonight.
then who did?
you don't give us our due credit.  our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
getting scared?  don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
it's like samuel beckett, you know- i admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
the man who sold the boy to your brother.
foreigners! fuck!
that's better.
i'll watch my back.
how can i tell you what i don't know!
what?  look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
what do you mean life for for what! for what!
you're not resting well, are you? i know -- it's that music.  you need your sleep. is there anything else you want?
when'd they file the demur?
there's no question you'll be friends. of course you'll be friends.
she leaves, somebody'll be on her.
you were ready to bite that guy's face.
you're in a good mood today, george.
do your covers and all that shit.
she'd have to be really pretty and i'd have to be very drunk.
how'd you guess?
that's <u>mad</u>.
yes, isn't it wonderful?  i'm so happy.  i'll bet i'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
what?
what's it look like i'm doing? i'm tuning a goddamn piano.
your brother has four days. fifty cars. five-zero. for that he gets 200 large ...
according to my father's tapes, this is the spot where general kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... there is no doubt about it, we're lost...
kill them.  not quickly.
tomorrow night.  can you come?
hello.
well, your pupil is married and living in mannheim, young man.
105-353.
don't let them do it this way, george. it's too important. we can't find this thing alone.
i knew it! i knew this was gonna happen! i had a bad feeling since last night. remember? we are so totally fucked!
in english, pinkerton.
he always did.
would you be more comfortable barefoot?  feel free to remove your boots and socks.
your people are very brave. they are fighting the chinese. no one can stop them. not even me.
sweeney.
okay, this guy is trying to scare us. he's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. it's time for an ass whoopin'!
tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. nice fruit.
i found it... it's just not there.
what the hell do you know?
if i licked him i would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, i was ready that night.
i have to go to new york tomorrow.
oh yes?
came from redfoot.
because, you know, you seem so distant. and you work late every night. and we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... i don't know. it feels different.
pat's an architect, too.
who will it be? put your mind to it, then.
in simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
blow the fucker up.
ready to go, mama!
i can't go to the club tonight, guys.
we're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you?
roger.
how's the detective business?
not very zen of you, huh?  not so much the modern samurai after all.
nobody's a nobody.  why're you crying?  what's wrong?
what's he doing in utah?
due north.  at five knots...no, six!
hi.
yeh, sleepin'.
you're kind to be so encouraging.
you were. infantry right?
i thought i did.
you used the toilet, now you can go - what i do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
it's gonna rain again. every time i wash the car, it rains.
look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' patriots' games and still workin' construction, i'll fuckin' kill you. and that's not a threat, that's a fact. i'll fuckin' kill you.
that's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
mozart, you are not the only composer in vienna.
you won't go to galbraith with me?
it's a .45.
the leaves...
no we shouldn't, but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime!
come on, relax...
don't worry. i can recommend a couple. they're expensive but you can afford it.
see, what did i tell you? man in new york wants a 9 millimeter smith and wesson model 5946. why does he want it? it's the gun that nigga on "new york undercover" uses. because of that nigga, i can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
i don't think there's any sense in --
no.  no way.  i wouldn't even know where to begin!  those thoughts about my cousin elena -- they were just thoughts. i would never --
can i help you, sir?
sean, do you have herpes?
cause i like it.
i've got to keep you healthy, jimmy. i'm counting the days. two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
wham... .
is freddie here?
i know. you loved her. so did i. it was an awful shock to me, too. an awful shock. rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
i could've handed you to them.  they find me now, i'm dead...
you won't.
you're a piece of shit
this may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
then take the pills.
are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
didn't you tell her?
go ahead.
are you still a virgin?
yes.
everybody got upset. they had a meeting. momma started crying.  i don't draw like that anymore.
uri geller must be on the premises someplace.
i think he's alive.  i'll tell you about it later.  i'm definitely being followed.
i thought subspace weapons were banned by the khitomer accord...
mr. dickson! mr. dickson!
yes?
alright. i'll see you in the morning. i'll bring you breakfast.  what time will you...
if that was suppose to be a compliment, i thank you.
california...
one moment dear... 
can you confirm visually or just radar?
what do you do if something happens?
the prefix code?
damn, you got a stalker.
...or films you must see or... 
we may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
yeah. no thanks.
no, but... he sent me so many signs!
what?
eat something, would you?
...well! i do believe this requires further investigation!
or her, or her - or any of them?
yeah.
you know the other day, you asked why i came back?
don't fuck with me ...
... um ... yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
where's your elastic brace?
sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
no thanks, i must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
uh, he handled rackets, and i carried the balls.
what?
well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  the bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  i'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
no... jason... please...
do cagney. like you did yesterday.
then these are all new owners?
i really don't think it's a good idea.
not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
you saw the news today?
do you know who her doctors were?
- in the gods - huh?
then what, what are you? tell me...
we're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
hold it down, okay?
the word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  he is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
where'd you get the money, huh?
tell them to go away. i don't want to see anybody.
but, bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
tomorrow afternoon. usual set-up.
but surely, i mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the buttles, and ...
a bird of prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
you've been real good to me, too. it ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. you and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  say that you'll do it for me and my friend, mr. fettes, here.
weir can't be alive.
maggie, it's just a joke...
you're right about that guy -- i think we've got something.
then i don't think so mr. bloom. if nothing is going to change, i'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
well... i mean... what am i supposed to say here, bern?  is this a riddle or what?
bingo.
you're here.
what was that?
mister mcmurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
amen
don't say anything.  don't alarm them.  just go!
they checked in.
oh, thanks.
what happened?  where's the rest?
and don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
thanks for everything.
whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger.
i am...
he left home a long time ago. he was in the hospital, up in los ang gleez, real sick.
good morning.
going somewhere?
just tell me where it hurts, baby.
he's going to be fine, right daddy?
is that margie?
watch the first step.
i've got a responsibility here. i can't let everybody grab free drinks.
...you are so goddamn weird.  oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
look, if you can get them to finish it by friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.

hey, pretty woman... sailor here?
so.  you're a soldier. fighting for whom?
boy, i sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 mb per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
oh no!  argon!  we have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  we have to get the nanobot!
it's too dangerous for--
inside information. oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? or someone overhears me saying i'm gonna buy teldar paper? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it's time to blow out xyz. you mean that?  i'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and i are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
... it is conceivable i was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
how may i help you?
the thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
yeah, right.  even i can barely read all my work.
how much?
depends.
...like the water purifiers?
sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  did you have sex with her?
you heard of a hacker called acid burn? you know who he is?
you'll put your clothes here.
okay--i mean--
and would you describe those years as happy?
carol and i saw you with that creep, richard, today.
oh, shit.
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up!  and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for...
you men are all so dreadful!
when he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
are you nuts?  they'll fry us for sure.  there's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  no way.
why should i?
interesting concept.  i hadn't thought of that.  if you think about how anton berger plays chess you might get it.
one more question. is this your husband's passport?
she does have one thing you don't.
i'm in the picture on wendy's wall. niagara falls. family trip. little wendy foreground. me background. what are the odds on that one?
ya still follow the mets, pete?
when do you think the phone lines'll be back up? i have to call my daughter, and i should call new york and let my agent know i'm breathing.
eating?
why would the kid shoot at us?
jesus...what do you want?
-- when i took you out riding, come rain or shine, because i knew it was right for you, when i kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when i saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know i was there...!  all i've ever thought about is you!
let's go.
what's it worth to ya, boss?
what?
hello, peter.
everything. i have a good head for business, i should be franchising the bakery. and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. and finish.
i believe you...
no, chinese food is fine.
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon. i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank's place.
let me have those.
therapy? hell no, i just don't want to do it alone.
japan? what's she doing in japan?
for the love of god. not spanish again. who's the girl?
... what i'm curious about are the wilderness years.  you're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  it must have taken tremendous faith.
not even that.
what is all this shit?
ya like that, chief, huh?
you mean he's your brother brother?  you made that up!
you don't?
her!
no, hey, i like your coat --
all right, everybody! that's ten minutes!
you going to sit here all day?
don't you want me to?
about twenty-four thousand.
hey.
i've decided to investigate low's plane crash. while i'm at it, i thought i'd look at the cases koessler worked with low.
ed, can i see you a second.
yo' bleedin' inside, man -- get that doctor.
you're a butcher?  what do you use pig intestines for?
how?  how can you help me?  with your flowers and your perfect life...
suppose a pretty dame into my castle came - and let us say that i was going strong.  she might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
vito cornelius?
you're beamen's daughter. your last name is different.  you married.
admiral on the bridge!
tell her i'm not here, tell her...
pleasure.
isn't there a stigma? bankrolling this guy?
so... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
made your million, yet?
he's lying.
and the bodies?
suppose i wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would i need a warrant?
i was just sayin' goodbye to sean.
only in a very general way.
you wanna get out of here? you wanna leave?
i'm...at a loss. he was part of that whole...yale thing, you know.
under the circumstances, i can't fathom what makes dr. argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  if c.n.n., or hell, if the e.p.a. knew what was in my basement --
sure. but i'd hate like the dickens to be held to everything i've said before, wouldn't you?
and these?
not wasting any time, are you, tracy?
diz!
why'd you apologize?
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of...
does it hurt?
you mean...?
do i have to?
that's what i'm trying to find out, danny. who am i fucking with here?
what?! you mean sex?! intercourse?  you want to have intercourse! last weekend you said... what time is it?
so what? the pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. hey, how about a date tonight, rita. let's eat pasta and roll around.
well, terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience.
a pass.
you paid $50,000 for your character?
what's happening here?
so you did fuck up.
they look like acorns.
he's not in this building.
well, i don't know, i just wash my hands of it, i guess i just got to love you and let go.
the truth is i hate them: they must hate me. all right, the money.  all right, not the money. a kind of put-on. it gets things back together.  well let's say i'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. i mean before -- before i got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. they didn't want me.
this feels... incestuous.
it's probably picking up another baby monitor.
what's with that laura? yeah, sure, take a look around. there's no one here anyway.
bridge!  can anyone hear me?!
you're crying. why?
you have to tell us now.
oh, no sir. certainly not. anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
who are "they?"
well we can't just stay here --
so far these things have not become hostile. for the moment let's assume they won't.  connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
you're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
yeah, great. the problem is, i have four days to come up with something, and i don't have a single idea.  you know anything about christmas stories?
yes.  yes, of course it is.
that's all you meant?
richard, victor thinks i'm leaving with him. haven't you told him?
jump in the water!!
he's going to take his foot off slowly, david. then you're to go home, like a good boy. you hear me?
fuck you. we shoulda taken his car.
no, i gotta admit this is peculiar.  did you have a light burning or something.
cinnamon... the spice!  do you smell it?
which way do we go!?
'i've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
um-hmm.
could be a shark.  but maybe not.
think of it... as a threesome. you. me. and... "jethro."
good morning.  did you know that?  you're always singing?
very possibly. come on, say yes. i'll buy you a shirt.
come on.
well i guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
bill, this brenda's randy flagg's niece. we need to find grant yesterday! the town council has lit a roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
mmm. and what else...?
you bet.
it could. yes.
thank you, colonel.
you're taking "no" for an answer?
want to buy a bed?
'sup jimmy b. shotgun.  get back on the curb!  now!
magda's right, i'm so lucky to have you in my life.
yes...what is it?
not if it works.
oh?
what happened?
hold that thought.
what's that?
how's the new job?
nothing.
i still ask, why do they want disarmament?
i'll see him alone.  everyone knows you're my muscle.  we'll make it social.  tell kross i'll meet him for dinner.  tonight if you can arrange it.
what are you still doing here, randall?
are you sure you even packed it?
slow down. smell that?
don't call me "honey," mack.
if you have to ask, you don't know.
i'm sorry we had to take the stairs. it was just that horrible little elevator boy...
can you tell me why you killed the puppies, plato?
actually, i've never known you to do either... but -
well. what do you want to do? you want to steal one or just drive your car?
no!
increase his heart rate.
it's only for the license. there's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
ah-hah, i see. a cozy dinner. but aren't threesomes a little awkward? how does the phrase go--
if that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. so long.
i know you... do i not?
"...did." well, okay.
where's mom?
so, i'm lucky. i'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  there's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
are you in show business?
i didn't mean to bite him, i really didn't.
good morning, gentlemen. please be seated. i see we're still dressing in the dark, eugene.
where is the key?
what?  come on...
you are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
all of us?
what is this place?
what do you think, eightball?
hello?
you want to sleep in my bed tonight?
i turn you over again, today, lhamo. one day, you will not be able to come running to us.
act surprised. walk slowly to the podium.  be modest.  thank them for this incredible honor.
i have only one thing now. are you interested?
right. and when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
want to work?
the sky?  where?
what are you doing, travis?
the incredible thing about it is, i'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and i'm getting screwed.
wanna go?
oh, tom, that was awful.
you know... i read once... ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
why don't you shut up and let her talk! two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
or, i dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
you switched license plates?
i did.  is that door locked?
just like i always promised.  now you're among the immortals.  you're movie stars.
what are you doing?
i do not love him.
all i want's the money.
just a second, walter. here, bruce, here's the check... and, oh, bruce, here's your wallet. i got it back.
the ringer!  the ringer, dude!  have they called yet?
i doubt it. but it's something to do.
was there any evidence that mrs. windham shot him?
it's ok, booth, it's no big deal.
do i have to?
y'what?
c'mon.  i want to know.
he wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. he thinks i'm mad because i laughed at him.  he's indian, he wears a turban.
his moods at this time were complex and varied.
oh, man, if you could swing something there, i'd do anything for you. i want to work with you guys.
really, i don't want to.
they have security cameras.  rooney would see you coming.
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt?
well... let me tell you, i'm not luke.  i know who i am now, and you don't.  and... i don't like me very much.
i dazzled him with my wit
you scared me.
mmnph.
you're right.  thanks for the drink.
all right, they're makin' a movie.
where you signed this?
how many times have you seen frank?
try and understand this. i'm a decent republican. i believe in richard nixon. i worked in the white house four years--so did my wife. what happened on june 17 i don't think the president knew anything about. some of his men i'm not so sure of.
it's insane.
is everything fine?
you must realize, captain -- we have lost much here -- i, my husband. gaston -- his wife and son.
what's it smell like?
i understand bobby beans came to see you today.
i'm busted up for you, but jesus, what the hell are you doing? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
who use to own it?
now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  tell daddy everything.
see? i'm psychic. not completely, but pretty much. that was pretty good, wasn't it?!
yeah?
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
did you ever take mrs. windham on a date?
hi, jack.
warden, it's not him. it was not fred madison in that cell.
i gotta tell you something. i kind of fell in love with her last night.
oh, rocky -- you worked so hard.
go back, michael... go back
my god.
no.
how do you know?
about what?
here you are.  do you mind if i ask you something frankly?  do you love my daughter?
what more is there.
this is janet davenport -- i'm the realtor.
it's not true, but it feels true.
i wish somebody would tell me i'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  my parent, she'll be okay. my husband, he'll be okay.  i even know who the bum is gonna marry. terrific.  she'll take good care of him.
i think it's nice he's american.
please.
time for sleep.
i'm sorry.
executive clemency ...
than what?
it was a wolf.
i don't want to marry him. i don't want to get married now. i'm on the verge of graduation. i want to go to grad school after this. and then i want to start a career. i don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when i'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  i've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. and i know that's what i'd become. sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
david.
i may have said some- thing. i don't recall.
how do you become something you're not?
shelly?
why?
evening, gorgeous.
uh huh.
he can't.  the bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and x-ray machines.
when you are ripe for my pleasure, i will enjoy the harvest.
it's not your fault.  you're right.  kit's right.  but i want the fairy tale.
she knows you love her mr. parker. she knows now.
the door ws unlocked.  is it always unlocked?
so duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
it's over!
that's cool.  we're gettin' to know each other. this is a good thing. i'm carter.
hey. hey. are you trying to get a hold of sooze?
will, i can't believe you brought skylar here when we're all wrecked. what's she gonna think about us?
i'm walking there kris.
take it.
the fog, terror train, prom night -- how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies?
don't worry about it, boss.
ah.
all right kids, i tell you what we're gonna do.  i've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
lina... it's happening. tonight.
dignan, calm down.
no, no, we must find the grail.
i haven't thanked you for your work, kitty. you're doing good work.
can't tell yet. where'd you go?
cut it out, will you? just cut it out and come back here.
but...what kind of a shooting war?  have they hit any of our cities yet?
major, that's not a good argument. if dr. furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. that's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
didn't look like it came from "toys-are-us", that's why i called you.
no, dammit.  it's a matter of life or death.
there's still something about this business i don't quite understand. miss lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
five... hunnert... thousand... each.
easy, liberace.
i'm gonna break your fucking head! you fucking jerkoff!
one question: do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
we can get a job with another band. a male band.
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
i know. it won't go unnoticed.
welcome, neo.  as you no doubt have guessed, i am morpheus.
he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee, he'll dissolve the body.
we didn't do so bad after all.
it's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. for twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. and then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
who?
i don't need one.
i'm going up to berkeley today.
yes.
i lied. his dad is still alive. he works for the post office.
i do not.
no...no...
i'd say this is slightly different.
you'll do it?
yes.
why do you do that?
press a button and they give us money.
what makes you think he'll do it?
...stupid things.
he told me there could be only one.
y- s-sure it did.
rufus.  but i don't even know where you live.
darlin', rose has got to go!
please.
may i come in?
eighth room down, babe...
so... what's your dark secret?
what's wrong, mother?
i'm a married man.
what about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a sunday?
weather's turning nasty.
where to?
his prints.  you've got his prints.  i'll run them through criminal index.  you gotta get me that wallet.
all went well. nothing has happened. ceti alpha vi has checked out.
dealing
she's off her fucking rocker--
a brick house says you divorced him. i'll put you on your honor. bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. and i'll take your word for it. now you tell me the truth. because you cannot lie to me. what's your name?
who is he?
...how do we explain that?  hey?  am i worried...?
i'm supposed to fall for that?
you'd love to prove that. getting your name in the national geographic.
you want some advice, friend? you get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
okay, i'm going ahead. wait a minute, what's her name?
all right, go ahead!  we go on to the next plane. bring out any people that are left.
what do you want? it - it's pitch- black out here. it's tin foil.
and you missed this?  how are you going to miss something like this?
you might make a farmer yet.
i've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
i'm not interested in your book. i'm talking about the building and loan.
why did you let him in?
merle... hey, merle, listen...  why?
no.
what's going to happen to stensland?  he'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>he's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
could you take her up right now, king?  other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
mary...
reverend edwards. philip edwards. you came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
you monsters!
in many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. it's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
please forgive me. because i like you. i don't think of you that way. but i'm mixed up.
we'll be able to start this afternoon.  i'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  now, that'll impress the governor.
i'm sorry, honey.
that's eight years of school and training -- after college. and all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
what about...
oh, general, the world is a big place. thank goodness, my needs are small...as  it turns out, i have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
i don't believe it happened that way.
why did you set me up?
were you an alcoholic?
and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet to.influence your command structure. it was a bold plan.
what?
you're like your mother.  you love money.
sarah's reconsidering.  claire, transport in five minutes.
you have to remember that i love you, that's all that matters --
reagan usually drives.  stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  when they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  and i mean vanish.
reasonable? reasonable? jake ... you're gettin' me angry.
they're all gone--or dead.
goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re-writes. it's like every five minutes there's a new script. god, and you just know this all because of stab 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
i can answer for this, it was self- defense -- i can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
thanks, but it's under control.
...along.
now that's a really big house.
she can't see you, right?  in the book, rule number two: the living usually won't see the dead.
... shoelaces?
no, it's nothing like that.
the jig is up, casanova. i've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
yes.
which would you rather...?
that's the trouble with you boys! don't listen when a man tells you something.
well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
there's someone in the house.
i'll give you a chance to find out. meet me in the bar at the brevoort -- and do it right away.
currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same.  why must you complicate what is so simple?
right. sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
you don't want to say hi to your father?
he can't hear you.  hi...i'm dr. weintraub....  i was on duty when they brought him in...i've been going over his record... he was brought in once before i understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
uncle louis, you remember enzo's mother signora molinari from amorgos?
you gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
it was pulsing on your sat frequencies.
i spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. it's beginning to get a little scary.
a p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
look -- i'll be in there later today. i'll come by and tell you all about it.
you and maryjane aren't lovers.
no one says no to pappy o'daniel.
and that you're stupid?
now you're joking, right?
now, if you took the ropes off, i'd be able to feed myself.
we~re oetting hammered, jason.  return fire?
i just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, i gotta go see about a girl."
yes. three thousand pounds. i still...
commander, i'm showing two son'a ships on an intercept course.
yes.
m'hm.
maximum intensity. yeah. i can't wait to get out of here. i'm gonna write. i'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. push myself away from the dinner table and say 'no more jell—o for me, mom.'
i got to at least try once.
did you want it to come out?
carrying out our mission, mr. secretary. if you don't mind, we're very busy right now. we need to be able to do our jobs.
no way butt-hole! i want the window.
you're asking me why?
the toothbrush. i got it all right.
shame!
he got smooshed. by a jet engine.
or the vitamins? or the...?
we can't shoot in the old mill.
don't start, farmer.
it's stanley. it's the steamer. fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . i haven't heard anything out of that ear since i was a kid. must have been that jump in the cold water.
nooo.  is it your story?
mac, can you hear me?  come in?
breaker there, earl.  what do you want us to do?
i think what you did...
c'mon, guys!  every christmas and birthday we go through this.
just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
well, i'll tell you, aunt theresa...
we're leaving from adam's. come send me off.
you're still angry, aren't you? isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at miss lawson?
subject to the king, no doubt.
i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
why so?
look, i know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  and i know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
i'm afraid it's true.
 yeah...
have you discussed this with anyone else, john?
i want to be an astronaut.
say, this is snugsville.
meaning what?
stand down, mr. scott. all stop. that's an order.
sorry katka, but i'm with doug on this.
what about ruby?
she's as much as said so.  but she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... it's just an ego thing with her.
i've heard a name.  someone they talk about in whispers.
elaine, i mean the mission has to be aborted.  this ship should never have passed fsa inspection.  this thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
how can you say a thing like that about an officer in the united states army?
here? what a joke. there was some detective asking about that girl.
so soon? without any of those answers you so longed for?
i like what you've done with the place.
comment va-t-elle?
i feel like i know you girl. i feel like i've known you forever.  you gonna lemme see your scars?
you knew about the squid not being normal.  before fletcher went out there?
then don't.
shut up. mickey, you and i can take her late evening.
all right then.  sure.  i could use the extra dough.
good for you.
umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
you say i am a crook.
mr. keating!
well, okay - thank you, detective.
well, why not!? that's exactly how everything works. how else could the city stay in balance -- you have a better idea?
where is that?
i'm looking for...
since the school is closing anyway, i'm going to write that novel i've been threatening on everybody.
i do *not* want a senator. and i do *not* want any more of this nonsense! emma!
argon's private lab.
indeed we were.
i'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
we don't need a bed, do we?
you do! you definitely do.
because, because, you know, it's a crime.
he made it clear.
who?
why not?
his first 'whiff'!
i'm serious.  you don't -
your vessel did destroy u.s.s. grissom. your men did kill kirk's son. do you deny these events?
look...i kinda borrowed the truck from andy.
come on, jake. that didn't hurt.
oh no, that was no spasm. i got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. the whole thing, with me on it!
oh, my heavens! it's gone!
not by me, it isn't. i know how badly i acted, how unfair i was. it's just that i..you know.
why don't we just read the scene?  candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
what word would you use, elaine?
i'm so glad.
michael called yesterday.  he wants to take willy for the summer.
reporting as ordered, captain.
what about you?  what's in this for you, eugene?
how's the woman?
you didn't have to kill sophie.
aah, it's kind of a hike.
good night, miss wells.
i'm not very happy with you right now, grady. but more importantly, walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this. you wouldn't happen to know where james is, would you, grady?
reggie -- i think i've found --  are you on?
you won't at the square this mornin'.
i'm sorry to go on about it.  but, i don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and i want to make sure you get it.
and so you do! the only time you come out is to eat.
...yes...
sorry about your friend.  and i'm sorry about...
not elizabeth the second, elizabeth the first.  did you ever hear of sir walter raleigh?
no one in rome has ever heard of him.  do you want to remind those few in the senate who have?  the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  forget about him.
i don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
she says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. she just likes it a lot.
i see.
to what do i owe this extreme pleasure, sir? anything wrong, sir? deltoid "playfully" grabs alex's hair.
i'm not sure if i can do this.
i was raped.  by sam lombardo.
you know what i mean.  i'm getting married soon, but i haven't lived the life i want.
i never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. i should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but i'll take that up with ruiz. i made a few calls back east. those punks weren't tied in with anyone. as for the welshman, he wasn't in on it. he was just plain dumb. as for you, ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
fuck you.
mine.
oh - tell me ellen, i can call you ellen?
loud.
conveniently enough for you.
that's really what you want.  you become furious when people won't make you dead.
on the contrary -- i don't want to have anything to do with them.
i killed too many barbarians.
do your thing father. don't fuck this up.
don't need it.  we're scattering the ashes.
well, i'm here now. i'd like to do something...
he didn't think they were risks. he was so good, roy, he could just play with the mark.
alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  you don't need to go to lookout point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
what the hell you gonna do with yourself?
i'm sure.
hi...do you work with my aunt?
thank you, sir. i was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
i didn't know.
you moved like they moved.  i've never seen anyone move that fast.
whoa, check this out. she looks like you.
thanks.
oh, no.
they need to run first and second?
where you been?
i'm sorry.  i, we
i see you as a young meg ryan myself.
am i correct in assuming, mr. kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
no, no. i wouldn't hire a display designer if i didn't trust her taste. maybe we should bring in more of that shade. perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
nothing more can be done tonight. the shield doors must be closed. i can't wait any longer.  i'm sorry.
i like yella teeth.
* so i'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * the world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? my actions			   * still have meaning, even if i can't			    * remember them. my wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether i know about it.			    *
...say, where do you get those things anyway?
they'll hang him all the same.
i am. and i'm not ashamed of it. nobody ever said on their death bed -- "i treated myself too well."
it's not supernatural.  mbwun is an animal.  part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam.
really?
what? what's wrong?
why are you here, why are you doing this? coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
no really, keep talking, i ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
some places that's what people use for money. they're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
i'd take him to the doctor.
... the needs of the few...
political.
big bitches need love, too, craig.
brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  in which case you just warned them.
why, that's ridiculous! i was on that bus—i told them to wait!
thirty-ought-six, norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
dude, let's help terrance and phillip!!
she'll come draggin' her tail back home.
what about it?
you gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! what the fuck is your problem?
you do until six p.m.
yeah... i can put it all together when i get back, 'til then, you know nothing, understand? business as usual...
enough about me.
we should be dead.  we didn't decompress.
i have a going-away gesture for you, too.
inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the boston strangler?  this is the fourth, is that correct?
it's mr. buddy felton?
oh yeah?  what did i get?  what did i get i couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  you think your company is such a treat?  your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... you think you're entertaining?
what?
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno's wish. a willing, billing, lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish.
it's that girl from the boardwalk. is she one of them?
that looks exactly like my uncle darrell.
straight up?
would you leave now, please?
you think that's too much?
well, maybe. but i'd hate to be doin' it. takes more nerve than i got.
when did this happen, honey?
you're not seriously buying into darren's nonsense.
you'll laugh.
women miscarry all the--
is this how?
toss you for it.
that's my mum's.
that too tight?
is that the last of it?
ayuh.
if you so much as breathe heavy on them, i'm out on strike.
jesus, it's dark in here.
i don't know. i thought i did. now i'm not sure. i thought it had something to do with me.
waves would be peaking really high and glassy. hit that water. ridin' the wall just perfect.
you're not from these parts.
she did, did she?  how is the old girl?
maybe by now they are.
i - uh --
i'm sorry.  i shouldn't have said...
look at her.
don't.
don't be an asshole. somebody has to stay with the store.
i'm sorry.  i've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
we've got to catch him in the act.
uh, right... and that was it. that's when we decided to start our own business. no more shithead bosses.
we're leaving them?
sustained. yes. the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
or what you see in me, for that matter...
that bothers you?
i don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  maybe we should go find your mom.
you say something?
what is it, a sore throat or what?
someday, i'll pay it all back.
i said i didn't want to do the sketch.
you don't need a lawyer.  we found the program on your laptop.
do you think he loves you?
no!
look at me. look at what they gave me to wear.
why are they after you?
i cannot go to la...
dr. hirsch, what's wrong? is this more serious than i know?
i don't like to do what people expect. then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
you seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
sure. i can sing "humoresque."
well, what do you think?
do you know about the chip?
you're from out of town?
just a walk, for chrissakes.
oh, you! i'm not talking about her hands. they're difficult to ignore, i confess, but i'm speaking of her whole being. her whole being is extraordinary. the way she talks, for example. she's so articulate.
you must have been concerned.
any further thoughts on the subject?
big hotel billionaire.  he was on ricky tan's boat ordering hu li around just before ricky got smoked.
you don't know what you're talking about, do you?
what year do you think it is?
i've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- i shouldn't have let somebody like willie go in there with me.
then get in your jammies and i'll read you a story... i think you've got a chance. the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
he who is not with us is against us.
i love you too honey.
it's stanley, sir.
i'm here with ed over at taxi. there's been some trouble with tony.
i'm a good worker, betsy mam, a real good worker.
what?
good. i want to talk to you.
you're all safe. thanks be to god!
can i hold him?
aren't you going to answer it?
want a drink?
the academy, then ciiac.
well, i guess you got what you came for.
think what the play means, william. perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
you must help us.
are you referring to the background score?
i can't say anything, i'm sorry. 
stop it, stop it, stop it!
i gotta go.
i guess you're right, but -
where are you goin'?  did you tell him?
are you out of your vulcan mind? no human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
he disappeared. later he was found dead.
and a special thank you to geoffrey and katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. they toast the cliftons.
sally, calm down.  we're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
uncle terrence.
no, judy, i'm not going to move! please! stay in the chair!
it's good to be able to hear that.
did you sleep well?
how dare you...  you don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, mr lombard?
we'll be in touch, jimmy.
i must ask you to leave.
we only owe the king a hundred and fifty.
what do you mean?
play it again.
i mean it!
go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
where you coming from?
maybe that's the problem.  i want... a family, ellie.  i want kids.  a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid.  a real life.  maybe that makes me a sellout but i don't care anymore. it's what i want.
i'll come to you tonight.
<u>what</u> union?
she wants it to come.
sorry, love.
i'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and i'm gonna find out what for. there's a real story, smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did i tell ya?!
i advise you to let us go.
how are the hometown folks treating you, back in xenia?
it says she was originally schooner rigged, but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  i think square rigs look so much more romantic.
wife, girlfriend or mother?
today, over at the house.
just listen to me ...
how do you say "quit my job" in spanish?
i don't.
why would she care?
it's a flare.
you know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
she getting good care over there?
you smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  johnny fontane never gets that movie.  i don't care how many dago, guinea, wop greaseball goombahs come out of the woodwork!
martin.
this time it's for real?
what are you dressed up for?  oh, that's right -- because the evening news is here this week.
you're right.  that sounds crazy!
i'm not looking to pinch you!  i don't care about you, or the girl.  but you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what i want to hear.  now!
you'd better not. he's really very dull. but anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. and the marchesa is the best friend of the duchess of chambro. and <u>she</u> will phone the princess de costa. the princess doesn't like me--but i don't care!
-- ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
what's happening to you, frank?  you been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  you let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  we were always small time, but we were never clowns, frank. what's happened to your dignity?
you're darned tootin'!
we saw the terrance and phillip movie!
hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...this whole goddamn...
keep talking.
i have lunch with rachel once a month. she's my connection to an investigator.
why do you fret about something that isn't there?
then why do you call it harlin's?
janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
good luck, sir.
a what?
well, yeah. i'm ... bud parker and you're ... um--mary sue.
all the time....
a shelter?!  i’m the richest guy in the building...i’ve got twice the square footage you have!
he's right.  maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, john.  a full and thorough investigation ... we've cooperated with the fbi, we'll cooperate with the senate.  what do we have to hide?
that's because he misses you.
you're awake. i've prepared some broth. it'll help restore you.
but yesterday... that actor asked you who i was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... i heard -- you had a microphone... i had headphones.
what?
him: 'do you mind if i come in for a nightcap, reggie?' her: 'well -- it is awfully late.' him: 'just one, all right?' her: 'promise you'll behave yourself.' him: 'sorry, baby, i never make promises i can't keep.'
did you ask him to come visit?
that isn't true.  it was about your father.  where is he?
damn! why you trippin' like that?
it’s just a scratch.
son?
i'll be in touch.
the bus'll pick you up over there.  uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar --
it's the nsa. they're the ones doing this.
i have bad fancies. i don't sleep well anymore. then i drink too much, and think stupid things.
feeling
i'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. you should see the tramps coming after quincy.  if you don't talk to him...
want to talk about it?
what?
don't start with your shit. don't you talk to me. oh, hey uncle gussy, thanks for years of service. here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. what am i, a retired bus driver?
yes, but i—
no, carter.  i can't take this.
--because a year before, the republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, muskie was running ahead of nixon then. before he self- destructed.
where have you been all day?
you have to be a hero. all americans think they are cowboys.
oh my gawd!
locked.
who's your partner?
the gunshot holds no fear. say it.
oh sweetheart! what was i thinking? mommy is never gonna let you go. oh jesus... never, ever, never let you go.
yes, you do, albert. talk or i'll kill you.
it's okay. you're all right now.
this.  no point to it.
uh-huh.
whattya mean?
ugly habit, biting your nails.
i'm sorry about that, mr. stephens. would you like to try the fish?

whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
we're going to tell them what we've found. what we've learned. turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
and spring fling.
stuff, sir?
work, work, work. is that all that you do?
i have no doubt of it.
heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
i like it. it's good for you. besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. that's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. how did you make out in the poker game?
they know you are tutsi!
that was me they were talking about. i almost died. that was me.
how can they do this?
we're not all frigid.
if you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, i let guys stand around and watch. it's a lot cheaper.
look at that. a fat junkie. that's a first.
ow!
that can't be.
they won't squawk--they're professionals.
look, mother!
showgirls. absolutely frightening. what's yours? wait, let me guess. the house on sorority row? final exam. graduation day? the dorm that dripped blood? splatter university? am i close?
get down!  he'll see.
they don't kill a guy for that.
well, that was neighborly.
listen judge, oakland's panther international headquarters. we shut the pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
see how she breezed out of here. like she had wings.  funny thing but i can't really remember how she looked.  i can remember parts of her clear as crystal, her mouth, her walk, how she shut her eyes when she laughed, little bits and pieces, but not the whole package.  can't put it together for some reason.
you are comin back, ain't ya?
it's stupid... it's so fucking stupid!
you don't have to make this harder than it already is.
this "super" man is nothing of the kind. i have discovered his weakness.
for pete's sake, hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
... if it happens, it happens. if it doesn't, it doesn't. do you understand what i'm saying? you never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. that's what we call a paradox. are you following me?
oh.
this is a good suit.
that'll teach me to wear white after labor day.
don't worry about it.
mike wants it.
i can get home all right from here—
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
did they ever find out who they were?
robert cushman is a lieutenant general in the marine corps, the deputy director of the cia ... and this is what you use him for?
then you'll be going to school here....?
one of your instincts?
on occasion for security purposes, to double for the president at the secret service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
what about the untouchables?
does maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
to oz?
how long until we reach the chunnel?
and you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
how are you feeling?
juno macguff called while you were out running. she wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday.
the doctor said it was okay.  anyway, i'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
great. hey. i've got a bit of a problem. i know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
do you think so? do you think so?
oh sure... gotta believe in god.  but i don't think god made man in his own image.  no.  'cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  no, i think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of god -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- i slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>booooorring</u>!!!... and so the whole point of life, i think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and god can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... not that we have to get married.
i do not agree. although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
you're being tricked.  sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  he's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  twenty four hours a day, until they're back on earth.
what's your offer?
such a beautiful view.
not at all.
they ain't sendin' nicky nowhere.
he has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  he gave dorothy a coach- and-six.  that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  faith, the business was well done.  your cousins, michael and harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to england, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to dublin.  are you in want of cash, my boy?  you may draw upon me, for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
and if i didn't <u>know</u> better - i'd swear we were moving!
do you think she might be interested in  someone?
no secrets, mister harding. let's get it all out in the open...
you're not supposed to like it. what gets me is your attitude. listen... tomorrow you show up.
oh, that was my kid.
it's you we're concerned about, janet.
what is it? you look like you've seen a ghost.
you got a drinking problem or what?
look at the size of those two beasts.
yes, i understand – but where do you take them from?
maybe i don’t.
'on july 8, 1979, security forces under control of the trilateral commission abducted the fathers of all american nobel prize winners. the men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  the sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the rand corporation in santa monica, california.'
i didn't even know you had a kid.
somebody's there, barry.
you took my workers.
like they do on tv?
boys, boys... don't forget russia is your mother country. three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
aw... that's so sweet.
you don't miss much.
for my hair?
and why is that?
well, what?  what, wh-what are you not telling me?
i never thought you would. that's why i've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why i never will again.
yeah.
good morning to you, mr. delapot.
bianca stratford.  sophomore. don't even think about it
meyer just finished the books.
what is it?
run a story. say john doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
holy shit...
i don't know how you died. the last time i put you in the jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
let's examine the facts on it. i say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. i say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. hell, world war ii gave us the ballpoint pen. that's common knowledge.
i am listening, my son.
what else could i do?
what difference does it make if i slept with her.  you don't care about grace.
are you going, too?
don't worry. i can protect my virtue. i mean, c'mon, wade, give me a break.
it feels warm.
dr. zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
what the --!
well, i do remember why i started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in new york with cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
look, father, ah... just because i don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
fletch, you want an apology?
gozer.
let's popeye around the chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
yeah, i heard rumors.
well, you did!  chet found out and he's nuts.  it took everything i could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. you have to stop this stuff, knox.
yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
what if you hide me?
why do you go on about that? what does it matter?
oh alex, get away from that thing...
costliest!
what is it?
i don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  is that clear?  is that clear!
yo!
give 'em a pull.
i-i'll do it.
ellis loew.
i'll drive.
undercover.
over three hundred miles.
the guy came right at us!
bollocks, i’m sorry. i had no idea this would be so difficult.
all right, it's a matter of death.
yeah... do you mind if i sit?
sir, we're being hailed.
how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
you went to the room to help with the birth.
i already have an employer.
my next delivery is up that way, so i'll be getting down to it real soon.
will you chance a miss?
what are you doing over there?
i don't think it's gonna matter. sorry, pal, i tried.
yeah watch the fuck where you skate. you know what i'm saying?
a little.
where're the others?
mother? 
...not at all...
that's a lovely dress.
are you for real?
i can't believe you didn't notice. my weight.  i lost ten pounds in rome
terrific.
we need to talk.
i didn't say i didn't love you. i said stay away from me.
tread matches. it's the car.
julie, i'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. i've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. i mean a lot. but none of them make me feel like you do.
so what happened ?
hello, gabriel.
in there.
the day walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? for lamagra's return. one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a tide of blood."
how are you doing?
<u>i don't know</u>.  talley talked those punks into letting smith out.  he's fucking us over, glen.  that guy is fucking us over.
you'll soon find out, you liar!
macy struthers -- god i must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
not a chance.
you heard me. a bird in a gilded cage.
we could really use some coffee --
they're probably guilty about what they did to me.
we should hear what they have to say.
 ...mason.  i can barely hear you.
margo, these aren't seed pods.
will it go off?
who told you this?
sophy?  are you okay?
if you won't read it to your own mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
hey, hey, hey.  c'mon you guys.  obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
something's making that music.
wait a minute, major.  "ope," that's the recall code.  where would they get that?
thank you, your honor. we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana, u.s. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the uniform code: 'the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' and, your honor, having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the xerox form.
just one?
no, no, don't go in there.
about sixteen hundred.
fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  they shouldn't be here for another week!  they don't own this house yet!
i don't want to talk.
alright. then i must never see you again. the bad blood will have to stay there between you and johnny for all time. you won't come to the wedding.
the scale... it's just...  so all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
no... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? this is it for me, wesley, she's the last one. my instinct says i gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing i've tried to teach you here --
we'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
yes, sir. but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. he has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
aw--
"beg to differ.  this casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
i walk in the house and before i can say "how are you?", "did you have a nice day?" before i can say anything.   pow she's out the door.
we're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
jake, you need to rest.
i can't.  i have to know.
i came back for some of the books. i am trying to straighten out the accounts. i don't hope to impress you, but i may as well tell you: we haven't a farthing!
are we on "cops" again?
so many children. are they all orphans?
if that ain't fate?... hi, i'm dave caldwell.  i do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
i don't know what happened... and i don't know what you did...
"phillippe has been removed to the bastille, to the lower dungeon.  at midnight tonight i will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  that should give you ample time.  never have i needed more to say:  one for all, and all for one.  d'artagnan."
i got no music!
oh, i don't need another guess. it's quite obvious.
admiral?
well, i'm sorry honey -
huh?
that expires in one week. you're not real fbi, are you?
let's go home.
jesus.
y-y-y-yes...
you want more?
no, gittes, you'll show us.
i'm at the control oaneh. what do i do?
i almost forgot....
i wanna join up, mr. rasczak. i think i have what it take to be a citizen.
good heavens, are you married, madox?
oh, god...
no, it was not.  do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews?
is that yours?
forget about leo's money, harry.
yeah. the deep south.
he left us.  we were no longer of use. saavik where is  the reliant crew? dead?
graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
don't you want to see her again.
it's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. we can't make that mistake.
well, maybe you'll get lucky. someday.
you heard me!
so, who is in the building?
we are not on display.  i am not a doll. i am not a doll...i' m not silly and cute. i'm smart so that shouldn't make me something, something so people can watch how silly it is that he's smart?  i know.  i know things. i know. i have to go to the bathroom i have to go to the bathroom and i have to go.
i don't know yet.  i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
i thought he said by the monkey house.
i can't do this.
i don't know, herman -- maybe you do.
he's not done by a longshot, i can get more out of him --
i'm fine.  you mean the board?  you mean the board...?
did you kill him?
i hope you'll be gentle.
who are you?!
you're not going to die.
this is real, i'm not making it up!  theo, you saw it!  you were there -- the banging and last night.  you, you all saw the painting!
that you're a mistake?
say something, mark, say something --
touched you five seconds. laid three eggs.
she made the best shepherd's pie i ever tasted.
but stoltzfus said...
sure, if it was really him.  but it isn't that simple.  jimmy's body died a long time ago.  and his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, i suppose.
really? because --
i don't know anymore.  all i see is you.
she was never attacked. i think she made it all up.
tom-tom's puncture wound is infected.
no. it wasn't earlier because...
who cares? chicks are for fags.
you want me to move the television set in here?  you play gin rummy?
i thought you knew... she was put on over a week ago-
somebody hit you?
...i can't make it tonight.
you know i think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. you look terrible, my dear.
mother -- !
but what?
partridge?
i've had enough family for one month, frank.
yeah, that part.  there's... somebody who's um...
i think he's still alive. he's got claret coming out of him somewhere. what did they want with a traffic warden?
where the hell is it!?
i know.
i've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  i'm in no rush for anything.  it's just the snotty attitude, even if i have it coming, it's still...
open and shut?  <u>open and fucking shut</u>?
bobby...
we can't carry all this.  it's too heavy.
oh, i love that.  i'm just great.  i'm so happy to be here. and i apologize for invading you.  and i'm so happy you asked me to.  i'm so touched.  i know how private you and sally are.
why?
that's not a problem, that's not a p-
you're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
you got a chisel round here?
okay. 
still, this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally.
how are you?
i'm sorry.  i can't.  i....
it's not the drugs, ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  you gotta believe me!
mrs. jankis, what do you want from me?
i'm sorry. that was stupid of me. i didn't mean to be so rude.
i give them back to the people...  i make you ninotchka the great... duchess of the people!... grand duchess of the people!
hmmmm, interesting.
where what?
she's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  but nothing makeup won't cover.
someone was expecting that.
i have some ideas.
what's her name?
doesn't matter where.
scarface, i have watched scarface. you want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch scarface!
wait! wait!
i assume full responsibility.
i couldn't.
yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. i've heard you have a refugee center at the airport stadium?
i don't want this.  what are they?
i know.  i know.  they'll say anything.
just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
from the psychiatric end.
what do you think?
you could do it.
all you have to do is say "open sesame."
look, get down now, you fucking drunk! you bum!
sort of like a new hobby, huh, general?
call me charlie.
you mean to tell me we're dead!
stupid is calling people in kansas city who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. right wesley?
we have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  i'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
what's wrong with you?
oh, no.
--thank you, heather arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
i realize you must have gone through hell--
hey. i went as far as i felt comfortable. i mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. you work when you feel like it -- you know, bruce springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
what the hell happened to you?
they said if i didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  what do you think about that?
what?
if the western woods are truly the devil's glen, we will see for ourselves.
she's not too well.
nice.  almost done.
you disgust me... even if what you say is true.
which is everyone you couldn't get in.
right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
do you do washing machines, too?
i write poetry.
deputy director koessler doesn't want zero. all he cares about is low.
can you tell me something? did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
there's no way of knowing.  without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
hi jody.
man, day-day is my people!
yes, i'm holding on.
thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
sir william cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom.  he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived. he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
i am strong, paul, like a lion.
i got released.
would you like a drink?
maverick.
the war.
close the curtains. the sun is hurting my eyes.
yeah, i had to go slummin'.  see, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
he didn't see me.
why am i doing this?
we didn't come here to talk about football.  we came here to end the war.
well, we got that out of the way.  tell me, celeste.  what do you do for a living?
"bring me a side order of mrs. wheeler."
we get out of this alive, maybe i'll take that miracle cure of yours.
outstanding.  then all we need's a deck of cards.  all right, let's move like we got a purpose.
i thought you might write again. now that we're brothers...
she dreamed this would happen...
how did you know he was a construction worker?
sorry i'm late.
don't litter my cab!
you're raggedy as a roach.  you eat the holes out of donuts.
i don't know -- few hours, i guess.
baby goddamn scared me to death!
you heard about your father?
then you'll like me.
cheese is particularly troublesome.
i hope you find this comfortable. this was baron victor's room.
a nigger.
where does he hang out?
warscheinlich ist der murder.
the cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
i have!
how's the new one coming?
sure. .
you think i'm a fake.
-- shhh.
why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
bring the money in and they follow it?
then you know how bravely your son met his death.
you got a cause of death?
you can't sell me that, walter.
how would i know? i once bet a horse. he went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
why me?
we have a treaty with austria.
as their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
you have no idea what you've done to me, do you? and after you leave, i'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. if anything happened at all! and i'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
what do they look like?...
yeah. it's like i was a different guy then i am today. i can't remember that guy. i see these women, they think i'm someone else, and i'm not that guy anymore. i'm not sure who kristy knew.
maybe he's leaving his wife. i don't know, and i don't care. lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
waddaya doing new year's eve?
you don't need to be here.
they love you, buddy.  they need you, too.
hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
you are looking for a place to stay, no, kate?
well god-love-ya for thinkin' i still could.
we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
the nsa killed him.
don't stop...  do no stop.
sven!
eww. no. that's gross.
travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
consider it a parting gift. vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
nah, gave her the heisman.  i'm working on something new.
oh?
you did?
i know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
don't you throw up on boat?
excuse me... you said earlier that mary albert just moved in.  how long ago was that?
he only had a hundred an' thirty. -- i think he's good for the rest next week, mr. gazzo.
who was that?
and she sent no word down?
things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
...without compunction.
he made an awful lot of money.
does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
well look -- i was kind of upset there.  i'm sorry i said those things.
it's not going to be very comfortable.
and i can never have children.
why?
you think this boy moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
where is banister in all this?
i'll be there.
oh chet, that feels fabulous,
my lord!
so i see. it's good to see you. my name's teddy.
what do you mean, they take out her butt?
let's get back and call this in.
you represent the united states now. we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
so he knows your name?
you don't know anything!  listen colon, these are my ships, right? so i'm telling you we're turning back!
are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? it might help to absorb some of that liquid. you don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
...ok... good.
it was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, i think they call it... it wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
it seems i can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
alright, no problem.  we gone.
you and i should talk first.
much better.
that's right?
dad!  i know!
you'd do the newspaper right here.
it's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
you have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. you have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
heather? wha...
and when i clap my hands twice, you will wake up. do you understand?
you can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  then you start to feel...unlucky.
he's the one who wants you.
i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. people say it has something to do with the ozone layer. what do you think?
i can't. i have to go home. i'll do it later.
i didn't know you and brady had anything okay?
sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but i promised the guy i'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
i don't know... i'm getting these <u>cramps</u>!
right. a clean deduction from observed facts. they've got to be simple once in a while, inspector.
no, eve. i like you to be here.
killian's.
you're saying, i don't understand?  i'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  i'm the one you lived with for two years, i'm the one you made promises to, i'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  believe me, there's been times i didn't know what i wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  but the one thing in our relationship that i did know and still do know is that i <u>understand you</u>.
i guess we'll need another locker.
looks like a cheap hotel.
i see.  are you a socialist, mr. penfield?
it took a long time, but eventually i learned to live with it. and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me.  i knew things about people, about events, about time.
i don't understand.
hey buddy!
i've never fired anyone in my life.
you don't come in here, talk to an owner in las vegas like that.
can i have my supper please?
...i'm pulling up, yuri.  i'll see you for dinner.  sure you won't stay?
beautiful! i'm waiting for the bump.
it's a thing she does.  she talks at night.
no, i'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
how close are you?
my name is parry.
you really don't act like a scientist.
huh?
we did it, john.  we stopped him.
i have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  d'you understand that?
who are those girls?
is that you?
has anyone offered you anything to eat?
i'm just --
oh, maxine, nobody told me. maxine, maxine. it just came out of me like a song, maxine. a beautiful crazy, song, maxine. maxine. maxine!
some people do it for compassion
be seeing you and johnny tonight... here...right?
karen, say hello to chili palmer. chili, this is karen flores.
seven thousand...
comfy!
why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
i don't know. waiting, i guess. you know?
a salesman! cool hand luke a salesman?
no, man, no. you can say everybody's a whore. she's okay. i mean jackie'll fuck around but not that much. somewhere she really likes you, lester, and it's not just the bread. she's okay.
it's so shameful...
now just a minute...
you learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. but then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
okay, you two, have a good life without me.  i gotta go.
why?
yeah --
you stole a trans-am.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
you're fucked, man.
did you ahh, love him?
you wanna hear a nasty story of mine? it's kind of sexual.
i want no more trouble, mr. fennyman. as i explained to you, the theatre business
no.
thank you, no. thank you, dear icey. i'll tend to them. thank you.
mr.-  taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
i've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
you're crazy -- both of you.
and this is how he came to the boat?
hey, caesar!  you take care of this girl, or i find out!
a long time.
teddy? i was thinking.
not just kids - - for everyone.  we're going to open next year.  unless the lawyers kill me first.  i don't care for lawyers.  you?
stick up?
freeze!
good. would you like to tell me why you're here?
because she's visiting me.
so what happened?
what the hell are you talking about?
give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
okay. three-twenty sycamore? . . .
what do these replicators do to people?
i said sit down.  who do you work for?
ray's with the f.b.i. task force, working on the prison break.
<u>i'm</u> interested in the picture business.  my associates and i wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the apostles. but unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
near death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  it's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
i'm a great believer in doing nothing.
are you okay?
i'm serious.
dr. michaels is right. we have no choice.
is that clear?
hi again, how's it going?
get that, will you?
yes, but you name names.
the deflector shields are gone.
why didn't you tell me?
no.  i had some legal training, but...
what she did not say was, 'i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' all she cared about was that look. all she remembered was that look. and why do we remember things in movies? because we can see them.
christ!
who's your boyfriend?
my apartment's just such a mess.
father...?
yeah.
i don't know. he just appeared as magic.
i got the diamond.  quell problemo, bruce?
you watch your mouth.
they weren't loaded when i put them in there!
everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
then what are you hoping i'm gon- na do? dissuade, or persuade you?
parts of it.
a thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
i'm looking for the writer.
your mother's in here with us karras, would you like to leave a message? i'll see that she gets it.
what's wrong?
clark, everything i was saying -- can't you see i only say it because i really care?
i thought you blew all your money.
how much you got to see the show?
nothing, dad. just re-arranging the furniture.
yah!  i... those are in the mail.
okay...i think i'll go talk to my son now.  how do i look?
how's marcia? she all right?
are you fucking high again? just listen to --
the kid - junior, that is - will be right down. unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
huh?
why didn't you answer those questions?
you never paid me for that tape with the indian dance routine.
i hope you're right...
al's main squeeze.  is she here?  i'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
it's a poison arrow tree frog.
easy ted, we're not mining gold.
by order of the master of the revels!
who will?
thank you.
marty, marty, you should hear yourself!
no.
i think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and i think i know where you are.  you're running.  on the run.  you're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with ian but it's going to be with a world music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "doctor who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that i do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. and with... him.
what happened to your shades?  someone finally step on 'em?
julius caesar never took no vote.
i was just the accountant.
what.
to replace a god damn radiator hose!?
you aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. damn, there's more of it than i thought.
men worked for santa anna down there, waited out the civil war. the land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at fort duncan and the men joined up what was called the seminole negro indian scouts. best trackers either side of the border. bandits, rustlers, texas rednecks, kiowa, comanche--
we tried to be.  we tried to be.
you'd better hurry -- i think it's going to rain.
nothing. i dunno--
hans, he killed by brother --
it's all right. he don't mean anything by that.
i tried to.
i didn't put you in alpine grove.
the...
i don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. i understand the problem.
i thought for hours about whether carmelita should accept bernard's marriage proposal . . .
i don't remember his name.  you must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
no way.  i'm not that much of a pervert.
hi. this is jack.
intoxicating. here, have one of these.
remember when we first spoke to jerry, barnes kept asking for jerry's real name?  but harry never would?  he didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "harry", instead of jerry.  we weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry, we were talking to harry... or a part of harry.
they don't see foreign women in this market.  how much did you pay?
thank you.  for giving a damn.
i'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
this is a very good inn.  shall we stop for dinner?
how you be?
what am i looking for?
and that's the basis of this "declaration of independence"?
[this is not possible. but in that house i have money. if i tell you where --]
wow. that's too bad. he sounds almost perfect.
uh ...
you have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your prince. i will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. but now, i beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. i beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
don't talk, i told you. you just screwed it up.
all right.  who wasn't in the o.r.?
why did he tell you?
you coming in?
well you started it.
nevermind, what'd you two find?
hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. it's one of the perks of the job. if you're interested, tomorrow i could show you some of my favorite spots.
do they have to look so...robotic?
well, i... i never tried.
oh. so what's it doing here?
how do you know?
oh, and austin...
for a fee.
no, i didn't --
is that so?
what was it for?							   *
with your experience, you could always become an agent. right, harry?
that looked rather painful.
have you a minute now?
watch your mouth.
it's clear.
the ones who could disburse the money.
adult education is such junk! the professors are so phony. how can you do it?
okay, then... otto?
i live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  my bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  there's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
i've been thinking about this.
prints?
don't talk like that.  there's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
we've met before, y'know, that white house function, the president had you on his right and you know where i was?
everything would have been better if you had.  you'd have liked your grandmother. and there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  i remember reading about her in the paper.  they couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. i still feel guilty about that.
me?
no.
pops, you're a genius!
and i bet i've kept that promise ...
at least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. i -
found him. kent island nailed the call five minutes ago. he's stationary.
look... would it be possible to make the "ghoul's wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
shit, sir.
we ran out without my shoes and the floor.  i gotta get my stuff.  what about our savings?
what you saw was a buck wearin' lucy's dress...  i found lucy back there in that canyon...i wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...i thought it best to keep it from you -- long as i could.
damn it, ben --
llewelyn, i ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
how many?
i <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
i'm trying to prolong our afternoon. in case you haven't noticed.
another man's life in your sights.
...i-i... made some mistakes and i spent some money.
not that i don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--i wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
look, kiddo, don't worry about it. i really don't care that much. i'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
hey... don't knock librarians.
are these not the answers you came for?
help yourself.
float me a hundred bucks.
ah -- we should invite gandhi. what the devil has happened to him anyway?
why are you so agitated?
what?
i do not mean to flirt, marquis!
we hear how carl...passed away. only a few hours later.
well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'dear rufus -- you belong in jail.'
hello, peter.
no, i'm concerned with everything.
get out of there!
what do you do?
mr. dobisch said that?
you still got the olds?
who wants fruit salad?
that is correct, comrade skrapinov. we have ascertained that gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the american government.
what else?
if you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
we can't keep open till four o'clock. we haven't cash enough to last an hour.
when?
it could have been worse. if the cops hadn't come, i might not be standing here now.
this doesn't look like the kind of place betty would go to.
yes, i remember. what do you do when these moods overtake you?
first tell me this similarity is not incredible.
drink?
adrian, you gotta come back to hell. dad's sick.
nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on tv or the news... why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
ah, my jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  he's a good boy, miss -- he just talks that way.
your dad's really gonna build his house?
i don't want him to die, i didn't love him when we met, and i've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things i want to confess to him, but now i do: i love him. i love him so much and i can't stand -- he's going.
yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
now go find me a big stick.
how much?
how'd it go?  did you read it to her?
can i?
i've had time to get over it. she was killed by wolves they think.
yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
hello? computer...?
i could help with the debate.
she's too upset.
you heard what i said, dil?
it has a pas-sion, 'the con-ti nen-tal...'
you guys are my parents.
that was very interesting research george was doing!
we throw away the whole head.
if these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... what did you say you cut yourself on?
i reckon i can hear him. tv option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
because i really suspect gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
car wash, captain?
it's not just art, it's history. something you americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
what do you drink?
i thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
32 feet, six inches!
and how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
you've made it ... brighter.
jesus creeping shit!
lookit kip. all grown up...
would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? what was the point of all that hard work?
you sure you don't want a ride to work?
trouble at work?
and i'm sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
what's wrong?
david, need to ask you something. you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive?
you mean,  me?
i know where he's coming from. the only thing i really don't get is why he dumped you. up until i found that out, i thought his judgment was pretty sound.
i just wanted to tell you...
i was just trying to say thank you to diane and frank and --
what are you talking about?
you fucking little shit! you shopped me.
the owlship.  i can't believe it.
do we always follow mother's instructions?
elaine, i'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
oh, shit!
don't take any guff from those swine. remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the right people.
what do i do?  i don't know her name.
that's the rumor.
i'm not going!
alright.
here, you want some?
i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union. sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
but i just became a private citizen. i can go anywhere i want to.
oh my god, look! is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh?
shut up!
miss channing is ageless. spoken like a press agent.
what kind of person is that?
yeah...
what did she say?
i don't remember.
"it's a perfect day for a monster jump."  hey man, can you like do me a favor?
why on earth should you be so depressed?  have you heard some of the things they've been saying? you can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
no, no... you left the patio door open. you gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
you can tell me.
did you ever have a roll in the hay?
cadet michael mueller, i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west --
any more like you back home, clark?
and i'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and i don't know who should pour the tea. '
i'm free. i can never thank you enough.
in and out.  yes.  and mama... and mama, is not your real mama, is she franklin?
it doesn't make sense.  she didn't know me three months ago.
and then what?
doing the <u>right</u> thing.  knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
she could be under sedatives, sleeping.  he's in the room now.
wait, i thought you said you'd never been outta kansas...
fred krueger's dead.  you always had a little trouble understanding that, princess.
and all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
a sense of humor.
no.
sweetheart...i know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  okay?
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
i'll call him, then call you back...if you want you could stay at my place.
-- anyway.
who died?
good night, jacqueline -- good night, mary.
why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, harry?
-- i'm moving to washington.
i don't have to like her just because you do.  it doesn't work that way.
it'll make sense later?
you plan on driving trucks all your life?
they'll have surveillance on us. we'll know only at the last moment...
what do those broads say?
shit. and you're eating my burger? you don't eat meat.
i just can't believe you could be so --
yes.  and	i have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
we can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. we must withdraw!
it was the only way to solve certain problems --
we're dead, right?  so... where'd you put the transmitter?
where's irth?
now i want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told detective lange. but this time i want you to make one small adjustment.
any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
tell me. how did your lunch turn out - with the man from hollywood?
rose, get in the boat!
really.
you fucked me up!
...should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
no... friends from the diner maybe?
if that's what you think is necessary.
ha!
i must be healthy, then, because i'm scared to death. i guess i'd better get back to yorgi.
i swear to god.
fine..
what is it with you people and pain?
i'm crazy about the kid and i got him into it.  what do you want me to do?
the door jam, miss teschmacher. this ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. so he grabs something from the table...
you've got something to show me.
how does it feel, keith?
you should play with much larger tennis balls. so how's alan?
who told you that?
jill.
well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... the disturbances, i mean ... but it's been quiet for years ... up until two weeks ago ... it was never ever this bad, though.
...not only an artist, but an instrument of change. we must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. we will not stand idly by as fascist bombs obliterate democracy. we contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in spain, it will spread across europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  the artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
-- no. no really.
well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
you're all certifiable, you know that?  i can't believe i've been listening to this crap.  come on, tim, let's go outside.
'lo. i've got to freshen up.
that's right. he pushed me...in the other world. somebody pushes me, i push back. so i brought him down here ... what's the matter, sark? you look nervous.
after that "the three musketeers."  i'd make a great d'artagnan.
did ya get the license number?
i don't know why i've told you all this.  i hardly know you.
what does that mean?
they've got jean-louis!
see you in hell, snake.
do me.
look, kid, it's okay with me. you don't have to play games. if you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
'"... or i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house down!" and inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
ah, herr case. and how is the artiste tonight?
you won't find it because no such telegram exists.
you know, this, what you're doing with your life...
i wouldn't go outside.
we'll split up the week.  you can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
don't try to get it far down. kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
i don't think so.
sir! they voted me most likely to succeed!
j.j., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...i'd rather have my freedom.
no, i don't think you do. and besides... i haven't decided yet.
i'm sorry about what i said before.
it's all right. it's organic.
give him an extra dollar.
what?  right here?
what do you want to do?
this is single-wall construction! it's just a shack!
yes dad.
so i'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains?
what are you doing... ?
how many guys they have on you?
i'd like to.
how?
this is funny?? this is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  you pricks! i'll see you in fucking court!!
i want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
well, i haven't seen any. i wouldn't worry about it. look, i better go.
the proof had his throat slit.  so far you're not denying it.
oh, good.
i want to be here.  in this time.  with you.  i want to become...become a whole person.  i want this to be the present. i want the future to be unknown.
but she still might call!
where have you <u>been</u>?  what happened to your wallet?
-- i guarantee she won't gain an once.  she's very disciplined.
he asked me again about you and the jew's wife.
<u>what</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
well good n-
no, i -
want some gum?
oh!!
your shot.
maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. that's why i asked if he was a fairy.
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that i saw him take. so don't be calling him a rat.
we don't have anything from the nurse association?
merle?
look, it's a fairly straightforward question. you're either divorced or you're not.
like rotting meat.
i won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
no... he's determined. unstoppable --
what about tonight?
why imitate a dead serial killer?
that woman --
yes, i was lying.
how 'bout a back rub?
barbara jean.
dieter?
i'll be going.  ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as king enters.
you didn't beat me.  you ignored the rule of engagement.  in a fair fight, i'd kill you.
- and for you.
amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
well, i've never lived with beauty.  you must love working here.
i haven't gotten it yet.
reconceive.
well, i guess he's found one.
sheriff deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
your legs don't look broke.
oh, i'll help, fletch. i'm a slave to that sonofabitch. he busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: work for him or do fifteen long. all i get out of this is free snort.
some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  where's my schedule? where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
you're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... you wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
i'm not leaving. i want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. three of my classmates are dead.
oh sure. let everyone in. from now on i leave the door wide open. let the parade begin!
you don't have any fucking money..
be brave, my .daughter. be wise.
the first one was fine.
i don't know anything about it.
led by the warlike queen louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, king frederich wilhelm, the prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of frederick the great, and more than a match for napoleon.  the king had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the prussian army uniforms.
i'm afraid that drink will have to wait, captain.
dad?
where is she?
it's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
please do not be frightened, madam.
i was upstairs for a meeting.  i've been hearing good things about you.
oh great! he tried to kill me! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you.
i've heard it said that way.
what?
as large as castles.
i may have, as... as i said, i simply don't remember.
that's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
that sounds so final. but are we really surprised?
the sunrise? what for?
what?
the journal was pretty harsh to roosevelt today.
mommy won't know.  you can do anything you want right now.  mommy won't know.
probably best not tell anyone about this.
wherever you like. here i'll give you the money i won, three thousand four hundred. later you can have more.
does it have to be an old mill?  where have you been?
why?
he gives a good report and i walk?
yeah.
yes, now that you mention it.  you seem crazy.  like you're on drugs.
a few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
but...
whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. that tells me something about your character.
help me! help me!
clay could save us an awful lot of time.
you mean behan?  then why are you with him?
i could have given you the world.
you'll be sorry?
rose, rose, rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know i love you? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? you are beautiful to me, rose, i've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. and don't you know mrs. hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
what?
you're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  the power's coming back!
no sign of the snowman.
he knew baby suggs?
no.
what's the status of the decryption effort?
ours is not to reason why.
mom!
praetor. you have the whole fleet at your disposal. they supported the coup, they'll follow you.
what do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
but then how can you...
if i'm right, i want to know. i don't want you to lie. i'd be very upset, but not as upset as if i'd found out you'd been lying.
i see.
hello, spooky.
you mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
are you sure?
stains of blood.
you're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, mr coghill. it'll take a little while.
well, who represents you back east?
it's more a place where souls are found, mr. riddick.
you're too late, jack.
you were very upset.  you're always very upset in the dream, but i never knew it was you before.
i told you the facts! he abandoned us -- those are the facts.
y'know, we've been, i don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
well don't drag your ass.  there won't be much of a window for us to link up.  we'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
no, i am appalled that i have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- i had to read about this in the tribune.
so?
don't knock it. a girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. then you're free. you can go off to europe, meet somebody, get married. my girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. not me. i'm gonna travel. 'keep movin' that's my motto.  would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? i can make more money suc... doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job.
one. it's ru'afo.
with pay!
maybe, though. maybe it would work. i could throw you an engagement party maybe.
david's looking for me... i have to go.
not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  hi.  what'd he say?
what about them?  they're lunatics.
you need to remember who you're talking to...
kalarjian?
please understand me. when i say she didn't tell me anything about it, i mean not until a little while ago. she thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
it's what you want from me.
front page.  washington post.  tomorrow.
what story, mr. rogers?
tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
no. i --
really? 
are you coming to the party?
where are you?
it's over, hunter.
i knew you'd make it!  where's your girl? didn't she come?
there's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown philadelphia.  i take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
it's the strangest thing father.
-ellie said she died when i was born!  she's been alive...? all this time...? why have i been lied to when -
bobby--! what are you doing up at this hour?
but if you could, you would?
epileptic attacks are murder on your system. rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
you're just scared.
yes, i do. you're right. i can't just let him go free. besides, i can help you from the inside.
mr. boone.  he is an interesting friend.
drink!
so what are you saying?  that the world of the supernatural is your special province?
i see.  and where is my grandfather's private library?
elliot!
oh my god...you're proposing?
your father had a stroke. he's upstairs with your mom and dr. bennett.
and you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
it's their country. this is one of the best deals they offer.
i'm curious, mr. boone.  what convinced you to come back?
hold it.  can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
i used protomatter in the genesis matrix.
already there.
then say you'll spend dollar night at the track with me.
uh huh.  okay.
look at the kid.  in this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
you?
so far so good. we'll need more pictures. why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
of course.
the usual.  doc.
what's that for?
we're gonna wait here?  the guy could be hours.
you can have one at max's.
first, we may as well decide on gender. have you given it any thought?
you back this mission, and i'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
we'll go back to his house, pete. there's still a lot to do.  analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  maybe he owns property somewhere.
well, um... litter?
maybe it's true then what she said.
i never looked at it that way.  you ask a lot of questions.
watch bingo? i don't even like to play bingo.
the dragon...
you still should've moved.
wait, eve, please!  wait.
you're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
i am.
he walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
oh please. you're blind as a bat.
but i shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, mister...?
and a good read.  don't waste it.
a rather large contusion, but i don't feel there is any serious damage. i'd like to keep an eye on him, though - i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
get up, damn you.
but why?  the students love us!
do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath?
it didn't hurt too much, did it?
which is what?
dr. thompson, just so the jury knows, you never treated deborah ann kaye. is that correct?
green?  did you say green?
honey that song came out in 1968, when i was exactly your age.
your mother, and your father
you gain weight?
what the hell are you doing?
no, i got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
hello?
what's the other thing you're scared of?
i tried to tell you louis... that night in paris... when i first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, louis... not even you.
well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
ray!  where are you?  are you all right?
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
boss, ain't you going to bed?
nothing.
pretty good. found out the hautmans are entering a painting this year.
i'm setting up a timer.  when it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  but not before then, or you'll --
and the notice?
a hundred dollars? i wouldn't call that cheap. and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
... and again... go on!!! again! there's a good boy.
that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. how'd you do it?
this is the last time i expect to see you down here.
jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a flyin' fish?
you can't get away from me, albert.
captain, if your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset!
lower the fuckin music--i can't hear nothin.
where's the hose?  we can set up.
li mu bai is coming to stay the night.
huh?  oh.  yeah.  tape deck.  couple of creedence tapes.  and there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
i'm not. what's the problem?
look! there it is!
on my way to the flea market in amish country. thought maybe you want to come. show me how to buy at these things.
dude, somebody's on the rag.
what do you actually know with religion?
with your dry wit and humor--
tyler...
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own. instead of trying to be a father to hers. except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
you don't believe in anything, do you?
what do you mean?
and there has been enquiries from the american embassy maybe they are involved?
come on, come on. what are you trying to do, kid? keel over? you haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
grusinskaya... oh -- oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya -- for the success of grusinskaya -- for the triumph of grusinskaya... and what is she now? just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- are you listening to me -- do you understand? -- i want you to understand.
come on, winston.  we can't quit now.  the holidays are coming up.  it's our best season.
what about the owner of the house...  ...this john diebold, any idea where he might be?
if you're selling girl scout cookies i'm borderline diabetic.
after the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
where?  everywhere, major.  everywhere.
so what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
who's your pilot?
two pounds, fourteen ounces.
i swear i don't know.  here's your christmas present.
you must be a hell a shot.
alright, sayer, you've got a deal.
just what did you get yourself into, jimmy?
hang tough, lloyd.
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse?
mr. gittes...  don't tell me how i feel.
that's fine. can i have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
he peed on the dude's rug--
we feared cholera. turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
this is not relaxing.
it's going to be hard for the kids when i tell them...i'd like you to be there.
oh, paul, you can't have your own way!!!
okay. shall we clean up around here first? do you think it's all right--
i don't think i can go on, sir.
an' how you do it?  how you rift cuss?
is that how you get most of your dates? someone gives your name to someone else?
he would deny a "human" connection is possible. he considers himself entirely reman.
who's there?
damn right!  that's what i tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
call dad!
suspect zero is a crackpot theory. you said so.
well, i'm saying this, shel: usually i take the contracts to the bank.  last night i didn't.  how did you know that?  one night in a year i left a contract on my desk. nobody knew that but you.  now how did you know that?  you want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  this is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
what the child?
coupla days ago they dug up a body in washington heights - mary finelli.  girl disappeared in '68.  turns out she was his first kill.  which means he probably knew her.  most serials know their first victim.  i'm gonna do some checking - see if i can put any of this together...
who doesn't have such thoughts?  we'd better get going.
yes.
but i thought you could hold your tongue.
what is it, miss vivian?
look, i'm terribly sorry but i'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
you are from new orleans, senor farragut?
yeah, i hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
where do you live?
the cart they brought elly kedward into the woods with--
hey mister. mister, i just... i just wanted to thank you.
so, how long you've been living here?
goals are important.
hunt? why would they ask if you like to hunt?
bela! it's so great to see you!  and eight o'clock on the dot.  right on time!
yeah, well i don't think you're very grateful. a lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
how is it any different?
...you mean it?
this was a very difficult decision, because i have three wonderful sons. i mean, adrian, so smart, so ruthless. and cassius, so strong, so tough. and nicky, so... so...
don't think that way.
i <u>swear</u> to you...
they don't have extermination camps.
susan!
god damn.
and when i consider that, i have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
i'm thinkin' maybe i could let it go...
i checked the medical database.  no one else is even close.
i don't care if it's dangerous! desperate times call for desperate measures, mr. mackey. perhaps i need to remind you of your situation.
i don't know, it was complicated. he's in san francisco, i'm in miami.  besides, magda's psychic dog hated him.
upstairs! up-staiiirs! there isn't any stereo!
what the hell you want to go there for?
what happened?
why?
she took the senate investigation worse.
you sure you're okay -- ?
that was different.
you know, in russia, there's no work for women. it's a different world.
ray, i can't...
annette harrison? i don't know what you're talking about.
shit.  you gotta pass him. 
my whales? where could you take them where they'd be safe?
i do.
the bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. but chickens don't give milk.
so why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
she's only perfect.
well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  i'll have to call her.
it's too late for that. i've gone ahead of the curve on this one. there's no turning back. when this is over, koessler is going to be right or low is going to be right or i'm going to be right, but not all of us.
when aid you get home last night...?
no, actually joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
abbe de coulmier!
i'll go.
listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
he had his palm print on the weapon.
pop!
i am here, captain.
dying.
are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
we could come to my room.
not really.  the last time i saw her was at that clinic.  that was a long time ago.
his stuff comes out of new york. bondage and fetish videos, gothic hardcore.  definitely not for the squeamish.
pete... i do apologize.
what do you do?
what? what?
tell him not now.
i know. you told me. i'm okay with it.
yes.
can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
what the fuck are you talkin' about?
captain, we can't trust anyone now.
hello, david...
ted, when we got married it was because i was twenty-seven years old and i thought i should get married and...when i had billy it was because i thought i should have a baby...and i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and--
... that's perfectly all right.
not for years. shangri-la will keep her youthful indefinitely.
i don't know.  garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
no, that won't be necessary. i'll be all right.
he is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and i have done my best to oblige him. however, in the last four weeks, i began a relationship with another cadet. what do you think of that?
oh look what he did in them.
what is it? has he fainted?
oh, she's fine. she's just not coming today.
you know this guy?
hope you don't think, browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that i owe you anything.
i've literally got to run!
i told you.
they're impossible!!  jesus!  i mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for tony clifton"??!  who is this tony clifton?!
'just didn't know who else to talk to.
am i being interrogated?  you should be trying to trick me.  ask me about tottenham hotspur.  or buckingham palace. about marmite - i was addicted.  or make me speak german, which i can, by the way.
i converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
that little girl? ha.  now go on, get me some tools.
do you... i mean... i don't think she should go by herself.
the nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, i should be only too glad -  i shall be here in the morning.
you know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
carl.
the baby they made up.
why don't you get a job? if you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
just curious.  back to business.  ever heard of a man called nix?  dorothea?
i can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old clyde fitch play...
i'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. but you were way out of line, nick. what're you doin'? where's your head?
not the usual swiss procedure, mr. bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
well, you're talking big money now. i'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. the way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. you see, i try not to fool with the small-time crap. too risky, too little bread. say 6 g's, but if i get the permit it'll be as solid as the empire state building.
then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
what?
call me as soon as you get him.
i am not talking to you, bitch.
no look, really, this isn't nescess ...
do you not hear the wind in the trees?  the songs of the birds.  the horses breath?  there is a whole world around you. alive.  living.  feel it -- become part of it.  live your life, highlander.  it's going to be a long one.
exactly.
yessuh.  joseph knights printshop. vacant for thirty years.
tonight i want to relax with you. the senator from nevada is here with some people from washington. i want to show them a good time in havana.
not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  okay?
my thanks.
don't eat all those sweets. you'll get sick.
do you remember me, mr. garrison?  i met you on carondolet street right after your election.  i congratulated you, remember?
what happened?  you got fired, huh?
i'm gonna kick his ass!
oh for chrissakes...  "white trash betty."  i didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered safeway.
what do you do?
sir?
what do you want?
i'm sorry i can't tell you more about your father's death, mr. starks. our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the alpine grove's staff changed and i'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
i'm going to tell you why. because when i tell someone i'm going to do something, i deliver.
oh, walter.  i don't deserve you.
no, no... i'll think on it...
not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  look at the diffusion, though....
you could have a great beach house for that.
this isn't for real.
no, no –
yeah, it's just a coincidence.
oh, that's tasty.
do i pay taxes? of course i pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, i'm not a liar. a liar is the second lowest form of human being.
hot or cold.
... nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
i embrace mystery. i don't know what's coming. and i don't mind.
you're not renewing my contract.
so what do you do the rest of the time?
you must enjoy causing me pain!
you can't do that!
but maybe you know someone who does. an austrian, in london, dealing in kids and snuff videos. how many can there be? these people supply to order. he has to be known, reachable.
still a coincidence.  timing and all.
i won't be able to.
this is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
i wrote something special for you. i got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so i wrote you a new final speech.
what are they doing?
did you see that!? grasshoppers! billions of grasshoppers!
it gives me... i don't know... maybe two hundred people who i know wear.
glaucoma?
thanks.
i know. i thought that was very -- classy of you.
yeah?
132 to 133 this is 134.
but dear lord, are we intelligent enough to -- suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
peter webber!  right.  quite the spotlight on that guy.
did you hear?
hey! i'll take the girl. i'll take the girl!
nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid?
bravo!
i was dubious myself at first. then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones...
jimmy, you've got --
how do you know i've been with several women?
not what you think. we're very happily married.
i'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
drive through it!
is it over 'cause you're sick?
benthic explorer, benthic explorer.  do you read, over?  this is deepcore--
get out of here, ray --
great, you can start right away. call me harry. now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? don't get me wrong, i like it, very much, but the....
you are direct, aren't you?
that's it. you get it quick.
so what's wrong with that?
are you alright"?
- and he seemed okay.  just banged his -
hi mom!
hello?
how so?
so. you don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
todd, there's a picture of whitman over the door.  what does he remind you of? quickly, anderson, don't think about it.
well, it's the wildest goose there is. risk money. very speculative. except, ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? i thought i had a prospect here. well, i make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. thank you, mother! pop goes another bubble! it's only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i can't seem to interest a soul!
well i have news for you mom. it is good enough...i'm good enough and i won't leave here until i hear you tell me...
he has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? don't you know who's in that car?
yes.
yeah, well, his eyes say different.
think you can get me any of that?
gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
because obviously she existed, right?
that is miss sherwood now. marge sherwood.
ok, i guess.
how many died?
but you're here. so you must have come to me.
do you always listen to what your mother says?  selina. something you choose your life. sometimes your life chooses you.  save the day..
you still gonna play for brazil ?
you know, this is crazy.
it is less.
do you know what c.i.a. is, mrs. lampert?
what's the story?
well there....  what's the difference?
mantids can mimic. we gave the judas that code...
that's not right yet... put back "president" and take out "dear"... how does it read now?
i'm looking for frank mackey.
bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
can't sleep?
well, thank god we are rid of her at last. and the best thing of all is that she's happy. the little nut is happy, she found mr. right in the nick of time!
what needs sorting out?
oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
there's an old riddle about two tribes of indians -- the whitefeet always tell the truth and the blackfeet always lie. so one day you meet an indian, you ask him if he's a truthful whitefoot or a lying blackfoot? he tells you he's a truthful whitefoot, but which one is he?
we'll use the wire.  never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
i think-i think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
you vouch for him?
stop doing that. we can all relax, it's almost over-
i thought we were going to talk. last night.
maybe by that time you'll die of old age. how much do you think you'll, uh, need?
contacts.
nothing more? just another feller?
hi.
and we didn't come down here to audition.  business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> nicholas calls.
wadda you think?
oh?
i'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp; as a japanese-american, i had been put there and watched over. i found refuge with the clock people, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains.
holy shit! they almost had us there! that was quick thinking.
from starfleet?
where's richard and julia?
mr. sulu... the shields!
what?
wait a minute--
i've seen one of these before. a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. away to fuck the irs. is that what you're doing, or are you the real mccoy?
okay, explain.
away from your crazy mom.
i thought you might want to be filled in.
[and i had my men ready.]
don't count on it.  i happen to like nice men.
except for small eyes.
do you know where you're headed?
i'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
you fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
x22. read.
meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  she into football, you know. you got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. i ain't playin'.
the same. same as what?
christ...
she's very tired, poor creature. you know me: i'm a real pig. it's not so easy cleaning up after me.
no.  i just kind of like the sound of it.
hey, munchkin.
where did you find this clown?
nothing is what i said! go on, kill me.  kill me.  i'm not afraid of you anymore. i don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. you're a sick animal.
jesus christ. and he doesn't have sex with any of them? they just talk?
never been this close.
no. no. don't you say that.
he's not here.  he's not at juvenile hall.  i don't know where he is.  he's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  how old are you?
it looks pretty good. there's nobody back here.
well, yes, of course.  it's great over here.  you'll meet all the greats.  james dean.  buddy holly.  'the little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
i have. i did. it's done.
i wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
they're stoking the boilers. as soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
i don't believe it.  i expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one i've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
you can do whatever you want with your own life. we're thinking of the baby, that's all. we want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. before it's too late.
stop that dog!
ah, let me have a little fun.
they blamed my family for everything. they always said mr. langston saved anthony's life.
uh --
you were talking to him! what'd you tell him!?
you're sure?
you're ready now.
what do you know about the highlands?
yes, harry. i can't home school you anymore. so maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
hey, mister.  mister.  i just. . . i just wanted to thank you.
please do.  i was beginning to wonder who this mr. penfield was.
no, faith.  they came out of somebody's imagination.
elaine, not yet. i promise you i really can change.
okay.
he's going to help the police. your daddy is going to be a hero.
it's beautiful.
gus?
look, mr. norton, i think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
you'll be alright. go on. big day tomorrow. don't forget to do that sleep thing i told you about.
sorry...sorry... why do my joints still ache?
maybe he just travels in bad company.
yeah. it depends. cause like this one time with eric, when we got blasted at his house. and smash j and dj flipper was there...
it's-
still angry that i kissed ya, huh?
go ahead. stun me.
can't tell you that, mr. gekko.
shut up! shut up! shut up! what's the matter with you, man? shut up!
coffee?
a leave of absence. until we've sorted this all out.
he was just doing his job.
yeah.
...cocksucker....
i know my rights. these are international waters. the british navy abandoned that boat, and i'm claiming it. under international law, i have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
oh.
on the nine o'clock train. that's the one he took, isn't it?
i don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
sorry, baby. i'm goin' to birmingham.
run.
if we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
what are you going to do now? call the police?  take him away? i must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
you know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
i guess so.
i'd like a little more conviction..
but, there is one... mitigating factor i want you to consider before you write me off.
you gotta let me finish --
but why egypt?
how come you never ask me any important questions? don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? or a cure for cancer? what about your family? what about people?
you look good.
what?
ronnie, i'm still a virgin.
might. might not. could say we're of two minds on the subject.
fuck you and fuck bowling.
i told you.
it's amazing how much activity is going on today.
fuck it!  he doesn't like me, john!  it's your fault, henry.
look at the weather! they'll never find us! we're near out of fuel. put it down.
i'm pulling up.
there are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
i never had sex with you!
you here again?
fine frank. fine. how are you?
what?!
he's trying to form words.
lots of history.  for example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor sirens?
they had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  and harcourt--
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
just like that?  you were in prison?
frank. come in.
continued
see you.
that's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
what if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
walter, if you have a point, make it.
we'll take it from here.
and who accused him? diamond louis! one of the worst crooks in town! why don't you arrest louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
david, david! what the hell are you doing!?
annie, what is it?
don't even think about it.
would you?  really?  wow.  i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home.
i haven't been a writer since i got into the misery business--
what have i done?
she was here?
it is, isn't it? and maybe it's a break for me after all. i've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now i'm out. i can make a clean start, and --
somebody else sure as hell thought so.
just checking up on your family.  i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... well...
what's that next to him?
you take care of paulie?
mikey was looking for you.
jamie wanted that. she told me.
i look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- hiya, marty...
isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
i don't have it here. at the mille collines. i can get it for you.
no, i don't wanna come -
i see you bought some napkins.
hey, you did the right thing. you wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. they have eaten your ass alive.
your father?
nice to meet you.
firefly... mmmmm odd name. mrs. firefly, do you know anything about the legend of dr. satan?
whatcha' doin'?
we're late.
my blood will soon reverse its flow. it's the same poison she used to kill my master.  there is no antidote.
flame on, flame off.  flame on, flame off --
do you think i'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
yes.
i'm going back for taylor!
you should always work with a spotter.
mr. mulder.
so, not married.  well, good for you.  you play the field, like me. a girl in every port, huh?
you want unpleasant?  just wait, i can do much better than this.
i changed my life today.  what did you do?
stand down your weapons.
he stole something. from a friend of mine.
is she all right?
they are the same.
i stayed pretty close to the compound, figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
okay --
why do you do that?
did you see who that was?
kurtz.  i know you've heard of him.
i can't  clark already asked me.  didn't you?  he used to love this song.  didn't you?  so he just said --  "would you dance with me?"
i'm a tourist.
oh, like that song...
yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
a discussion between an american embassy official and a un colonel.
and yet you chose to leave him?
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
it's really cold.
ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
someone tell me this is really happening.
i'm turning you.
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- gabriela is relevant.  when i spoke to you before i didn't know she'd been seeing eduard.
like what?
that's what you told me two days ago!
how'd that happen!  what kind of trouble you in?
you sure about that?
sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
you can trust me, judy.
you're dead, lilly, it worked.
hello, helen.
oh, thanks very much. and there had better be something there for us.
i'll do it.  just let me find my portable phone.
then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
have they heard from father yet? has he seen -
klingon bird of prey, sir! she's arming torpedoes...!
and jewish men like to get it.
tell him i'll be right there...  well, what is it?
who?
the little creep hates it that eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
not a clue.
oh yes! it was wonderful!
no, no, no, no, i don't wanna be stuck with the guy. i want the tickets.
they're gone.
sometime?
i...
a hired player no longer. fifty pounds, will, for the poet of true love.
that's all. i just liked smelling her hair.
i have to speak to my father.
oh, what's that?
yo' yellow, old man.
hi
hey, sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
it is not beautiful.
how did you know?
hit me.
don't shoot me, i'm just the piano players.
i... i'm leaving... i can't take anymore...
she's just standing around -- not doing much.
-- ten blocks?  are you crazy?  it's christmas eve, thousands of people -- the mayor'll scream bloody murder --
spock - what are you doing in this neck of the woods?
she tells you you're ugly?
what was the color of tim's belt?
oh, stop behaving like a fool, martins.
leo's gotta get to burial, brother. he's gotta make the journey.
all right. good luck with veronica. if you want, i can talk to her, you know, and explain...
thanks, meurice.
not through any help of yours, hildy.
nilsen.
he was out when i was there. if he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
then explain it, whatever it is. it could save the voyage. i've spent years planning this. my entire fortune.
you don't aim to cause any trouble – but?
i appreciate that.
is that what she said?
and, i remember breaking your nose.  you're only alive because i didn't kill you.
sorry, preysing. 
karl, why don't you and melinda go take a walk. it's nice out.
i gotta tell ya, dave.  i've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  who does these books?
see you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
she says she has a secret to tell.
what'd you do?
she doesn't lie!  you sure you fed her?
mary! come back ...
you're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
oh, i don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, grady.
tell me, damn you!
sure does. but i'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
hey...!  hey, i'm talking to you, inspector!
that's the truth.
good, james. if the zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
someone is playing with you.
serving with you has been an honor.
really?
yeah?
gene -- you smilin'?
no! no, it's him!
goddam it... the little punk bests me again, i get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
which one?
goodbye, bobby.
i can't find it, mon!
why?
don't be like that --
you don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
well, i had a really good day, you know that? it was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
but where'd you go, toto?!!
don't give me you line of shit.
beautiful.
-- well it was very hot so i'd left the door open and the water was running so i didn't hear him come down the stairs...
nice. always a good idea to show up your instructors. he nods toward jester, glaring at them from his a4. goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat.
will…where is mercutio?
i want you to stop seeing her.
i - i'd really rather not...
you just don't get it, do your reggie?  there isn't any deal. i own your ass.
no, see, i don't need a finder's fee, i need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. i need the principal.
this mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
who is he, aramis?
mom doesn't like me to have them.
that's too many.
are you wearing a uniform?
go ahead.
he taken the lord's name in vain and he trampled on his holy book!
your spiderman pez dispenser! 
he hates me.
never.
well! hear anything? any sign of him?
no!
yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
i'm going home.
i'd like to smoke a cigarette.
who's got a gun?
yes.
i could see you were pining away--
thank you, mom! thanks, dad!
i gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
so what? we gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
okay, i'll kill you when you change, i swear to god in jesus christ's name.
kids are not your thing, deborah. you’d have been ready for me when i turned up with ‘sleeping beauty’. damn it! then too i should have paid more attention. “not leon,” you said. it struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. you didn’t say ‘my god!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved. “not leon.” who then?  you sure were right about one thing, deborah, the job was too formidable for me. i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles. but there i was focused so hard on friedman i’d stopped thinking. nothing added up - leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping friedman into selling him a little boy... you sure were right. the job was too formidable for me. but you knew that, didn’t you?
chicago's only about 400 miles from here. i could be there in -
rush her.
what's with that guy?
what?
that's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
well, no, i didn't actually.
why? why 'come on' all the time? what's the matter?  are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? here, drink it up! aren't you having any fun? where was i?
normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. the last we heard from him was two days ago.
a thousand apologies. we have failed you.
fuck that shit, man. i ain't shootin' anybody.
are you out of your mind?
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
even as the federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, kirk was secretly developing the genesis torpedo! conceived by kirk's son and test detonated by the admiral himself!  the result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "the genesis planet..." a secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the klingon people!  we demand the extradition of kirk! we demand justice!
you're going to have a lot of work to do when i get back.
i'm afraid it is important.
you--don't know it, do you?
call it?
i don't know, beth.  i wasn't there.
i don't know what you're talking about, man.  even if i did, i'm not so crazy i'm gonna cross zimmermann.
charles, there's someone else coming along too.
do you have something to say?
of course.
-- understand what you're asking for here. the massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. no one can profit from the marriage. the pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
you don't understand about the sphere.
it had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
you used my savings!  you stole my savings.  if my father were here...
sure i did, that's why i'm here.
don't worry, i'll give you a hand as soon as i can.
let me.  i'm jeffrey.
that's up to your guy on the boat.  seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. make sure he got it right.
another sex dream?
what?
that girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
why didn't you tell me sooner? i would have switched doctors!
you're calling me on is phone?
well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
i'd hardly describe it that way —- the worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
i was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and i found this.
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, kal-el. could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
i've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
that's what everybody says.
you never heard the story of saint severin driving the werewolves from paris?
braddock -- braddock?
where did you get this?
goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
call them back.
you should feel good about this.
my problem is i come here to drink in peace.  so if you don't mind...
mr. duke tonight i'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide american casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
he must not know. gruner just made the switch back.
larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. but they got him!
well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
no, i've never seen him before.
the next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  his fingers... his fingers...
sweetie, have you ever heard of walt whitman?
two sides?  you're dr. jeckle and mr. jackass.
if i have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may i offer you immediate satisfaction?
where you going?
get your hands off of her.
the war? what, are you crazy?  there are things i miss about it.
well we're off and running.  just acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental.
we don't need the tapes --
so are we, it looks like.
boats.  you go out in them. you come back in them.  i hate them.
a distinct flushing around the cheeks. she was drunk, i tell you.
what do you mean?
okay. she's really pretty great, isn't she?
i know she must be a really passionate person.
oh dear.  i <u>have</u> made you nervous.
oops. sorry.
his mother's side.
man, you play like a kokonut. you got to call him at least.
i don't know anything about these papers, sir.
what in the hell?
come on jennie. you look sad. just take it.
i don't want that to happen.  why would i want that to happen?
all our parents are weirdoes. i think my dad is into hookers. i know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
before i forget, your father has papers in the basement i'd like you to go through. i wouldn't know what's important.
'cause she didn't drift. he weighted her down.
are the russians here?
ooh, now, see, if i'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, i'da done this different.  let's start over.  my name's george.  what's yours?
what?  are you nuts?  just the two of us?
the comedian.  he's dead.  murdered.  that's all i know.
yeah, i think i'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
b.o.q., south side.  take a starboard tack out the door.
how long have you been setting up?
not too far.  are you a bird-watcher too?
returning to the western woods?
i'll pick you up in a half an hour.
well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
no, nick, no --
are you a close friend of haven's?
when i was first married.
all right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and i'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
if i don't see it in front of me, you're right. it ain't shit.
unless, of course, if-if you had some time, i mean, we could get some coffee.
i'll not endure him.
don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
well, why don't i just say black so you can say white!  don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. he hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! you should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "worth every penny."
i'm going to put them on the cat.
i said, let's go.
not your fault...
i'm putting liquor in the drinks, i'm giving 10-times odds on craps, i got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! show me another buffet's gonna offer you coke and pepsi! whaddya want me to do?!
what do i do when i'm around someone i know?
hey, ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
what is this, man?
tapert.  so, now i've got tapert, butterfield.
and those are luke's and mine.
oh, please.  how am i supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- johnny cash here tells me i'm going to skull island?
you – must – open – me – up – again?
where are you from most recently?
well, how about if i guess, then? black: vast space.  deep. spiritual. the essence of infinity.
what i don't understand is why they asked marliston if rod was a virgin. they could have asked you cindy.
gwen.
well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  ah, tomorrow!
who have you been talking to, jerry?  who else knows what you know?
a million! i don't have that kind of money.
let's disregaed rank... everybody hear that ? rank is not an issue here.
the ark of the covenant.
folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
bill cox is goin' to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
shut up!  i saw you.  you were in the car.
we've hit a snag. our project leader has vanished. along with all his research. uh, we received a cable from his colleague, doctor schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  i want you to pick up the trail where he left off. find the man and you will find the grail.
how about richard grayson, college student?
so how ...?
sure am, who are you?
oh, hi!  did you find her all right?
when we had trouble before it was different.
than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
do i wanna go to memphis and get married?
and...you know jan gruner?
just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
no, i mean in your pregnancy.
why did you do that?
i'd love to.
good to see you, general.  this is pastor collins, director of civil defense.  sheriff bogany, head of the local forces ... miss van buren.
two hours at prayer!
so, you didn't mention my name? you haven't talked to anybody about me?
oh, yes... i think...
i am at your service, mr. cosgrove. how much do you wish to spend?
hello, my little boy.
oh, you've been thinking. and?
you holding up alright?
yeah, it's me.
no. no, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, i can't think of any words. would "great" be insulting?
i don't know. it hurts, harry. some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
what!
you'll get through this. you were fine for over three weeks.
well, hell, i guess that's it, then, huh? they're scarred for life.  they're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
they're here!  they're here!  we have the nanobot.
absolutely not.  probably one or two hours.  four at the most.
here i am, honey, and i'm all yours.  remember when you were queen of the prom? all the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  but now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
right.
down here. darling, we figure: if you're taking a trip to god knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
what became of the princess?
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene --
let's say a 10% finder's fee?
kevin, my father needs a doctor.
it's a good thing my family loves you.
have you no feelings, woman?
ok, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
did you ever see a lion that size?
sam! do me a speech, do me a line.
mother...
the difference is you exploit a weakness.
you ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
go on.
yes, sir.
...but 'lias is still out there.
yes, that would be nice - i'll call round some time...
you can't testify.
he liked you ... i could bawl my head off!
private.
noooo....
could you tell me when's the next train?
no sir -- this is where joel lives.
now about the falkner sisters. that's kind of funny. i mean about mr. cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here. do you mind if i talk to them?
okay. so what? stop worrying. i've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
and i'm making mine.
three? that ain't bad considerin'.
where... where am i?
what time does the bus leave?
left field somewhere.  well, bill, i want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
fucking crow.
john, how are you?
exactly. 'cept this gillette guy. he gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. meanwhile, the king sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door.
why do my eyes hurt?
cannon fodder.
joe! you *told* him to!
well now you do.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which i assure you i have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
i'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
it's legitimate.
yah.
yes, darling.
how can you tell it's a female?
don't look good for "trial of the heart."
lila?
your sister said you don't have a family?
i just can't.
mmmmm!
what?
you shouldn't.
the police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
you remember what happened next?
no don't.  you could lose me for good.  don't go through that tunnel.
affirmative.  can you get your chopper airborne?
go back to the bus and reroute the call.
thought you two were file-closed.
that's where we're going.
yes.
is this one of frank's shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
i know what you mean. i've got the same problems. i just can't get things organized. little things, i mean. like my room, my possessions. i should get one of those signs that says, "one of these days i'm gonna get organezizied"
this ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
it's our secret.  honest.  how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
he's an organic farmer.
what did i know to tell him. you're hurt, ain't you?
that's very funny.
i hadn't noticed.  i've seen you around.  what's your name?
more or less.
don't fail me.
you put him down or don't bother coming back.
as one woman to another -- i'm sure she'll understand --
i understand, sir. but you are an honored guest of the united states...
other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that i can see, not on the outside.
here's his line.  we can haul him out of there if we have to.
wait a second--
it's okay.
whoa.
who the fuck are you, man!  come on, man!
no, but you sucked enough dick!
not talk!  i said talk!!
what's he doing?
put your hand in my pants.
oh, now he's adorable.
look, i'm sorry i yelled, okay?
look, what you worried about glenn for?  what's he know?
john:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
no.
and what can he do for you?
some fishermen in west virginia found an unidentified girl's body. it's a buffalo bill-type situation. been in the water about a week, and jack needs somebody that can print a floater. think you can handle it?
no need lie, boy.  i no hurt you. do i look like i wanna hurt you?
will you read it for me?
it's pay day, ain't it?
i do, beautiful horses. thank you, holiness.
put them down.
you should have seen this octopus furnace. i had to get out my hazmat suit just to get up in there...
harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. it's on the sea dolphin ii.  and thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  we're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in philadelphia on june 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
i see.  yes, of course.
well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
see this. solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. probably worth thirty.
nope.
where?
it's the guard in the storeroom.
jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  you staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
where'd you get that gun?
bombers.
okay, so maybe i'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  you want to listen, for once in your little lives? you want to pay some attention?
how the fuck am i supposed to know that?  you might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
eagle thrust four -- big duke six. join me in sparaying some trees.
i thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
no, baby, nothin' like that. look, there's a place across the street. we can go right over there...
oh, lord....
the containment, second containment...
i could give you reasons. her silence. her youth. it's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
lookin' to make the papers, john?
that ain't what i mean.
yes. from wendel. to celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. i forgot to tell you.
i'll need to know more about this thing.
i will!  goodbye, darling!
i hear you've been looking for me.
forgive me father.
iraqis.  a bunch of them.
i don't like to talk about it.
and believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
did you see him?
soviet sb-9 nuclear torpedo. yield, one kiloton.
you ever feel bad about any of this?
including rape, pillage, murder.
oh, no, ma'am.
i should have known, shouldn't i?
maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
great.  this is great.  the whole town knows.  just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
kids? what about them?
 gee, you think so?
okay, look.  it's an important meeting. kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
yes, mr. vesci.
uh, huh...
why--i--er thought with all this heat turned on i'd hide it.
yes, that would certainly do...
what?
take 'er on down, al. i'll sign.
yeah.
cut that shit out.
no.  i want to buy a dog. 
that place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  get me two.
thanks.
suffering. you exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
they're ready for you, sir.
how bad is it for you?
yes.
how'd your baptizin' go?
that's for me to know and for you to find out. i'll see you. i mean call you. okay?
he's harmless.  back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley. i think he did too much lds.
very generous of you all.  how much?
i am giving her a chance.  why don't you get off my back?
that should be enough. can you enclose it to hold water?
you need a cut.
you're fishing. you don't know shit.
you leave that gun alone!
careful...careful.
when i first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher i got really afeard.  i thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
what are you doing?  you've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium?
hurry!
i'll be a few minutes.  wait here --
i don't think i can wait until tomorrow. this needs clearing up.
together we stand!
no.
this is a joke in very poor taste.
where do we come in?
confession. i'm a complete softie. i've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
sure there are--and i've tried them all.  plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
hey, what are you doing? why are you wearing a suit again?
me? what if she don't want me?
you don't have to get uppity with me, bill. i remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. and what was that other thing you tried? a dairy queen? went busted too.
no shortage of suspects.
had his apartment been burglarized?
do you have the material?
who's fighting? why are you so defensive?
oh. no. strictly dryland.
what about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
i'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. somebody who wants me as i am will maybe walk into the place where i'm working and take me out of there.
well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
what the fuck are you doing?
god, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
come on.
you remember samuel, my son.
the hospital.
ain't your fault.
why?
i should have damn well bought it.  well, we can't afford it.  the movie's going to eat up a year of my life and i'm getting paid next to nothing.  do you know how much skye davidson's getting?  four million.
why, he's speaking english.
what was the response?
fair enough.
nudie pictures, what do you think?
my father's house.
i'm serious! i'm just so sick of everybody! why can't i just do whatever i want?
all right, then.
feel that?
you'll see her die, that's all. they're mortal, despite what she told you.  she will die.  then what will you do?
...they're in penthouse k.
the one to town is, but that's about it. i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. i told him who you were and what had happened. he said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
no. i think you're talking about you. i'll tell you right now that i'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, i'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
the sweep is just routine, not even police action.  i'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
--but i think the thought has crossed your mind.
are you trying to be funny?
no.  you're right.  that's for later.  we'll talk in a month. what have you got?  i want two sits. tonight.
about what?
and i'm telling you:  you wanna throw a birthday party:  every kid gets a chance to play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
i understand.
_answer_ me.
all right, look.  i can make it right, i can make this up to you, mattie.  i can, i swear.
put it away, jack. you know you won't use it.
yes. i lost my remote control.
did you touch anything? move anything before we got here?
for the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
don't i know it.
so who's got time to get married ?
i was there, and it was no suicide. he was killed by professionals.  i was in the bathroom when it happened.
it's gonna cost ya money. it always does.
what are you doing?
suicidal...
at-at-at-at-at.  at-at-at-at-at.
do i have to?
they might. yes. that's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. they're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. i'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. and every one of them it's written on their face, 'this is a sham. there is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'maybe... maybe...'
one guy do all the damage?
just don't know why i'd be doing it.
she has an aunt, in vermont. i'll take her there tonight.
yeah. as a girl.
for her?
kim denied it. but he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with duane lindeman.
i'll go. i'll bring jake out here.
i'm sorry, bill --
...don't be crazy. put it to your school loans.
i guess so.
when did you decide all this?
"is the day so young?"
i ordered no interruptions.
billy clanton, wes fuller, and billy claiborne.  now there's six of 'em.  this is like a bad dream.
found it.
this one guy on death row, who i'll call henry, told me about his last victim. henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named adele. her mother's in the living room watching tv. she's got the volume on so damn high he can hear david letterman's jokes. henry puts his hand over adele's mouth and says, "if you scream, little girl, i'll kill your mother." and of course little adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  ten days later they find adele's body. or what's left of it.  you believe in fairy tales?
it's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
... yes?
oh?
lieutenant... i'm danny walker.  i'm rafe mccawley's best friend.
and -- what path is that?
as a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
since what?? did you have a fire at your house or something?
continue forward, sir?
we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... i am the blue raja, master of silverware... 
you've got to put this on.
we can't let you do that.
jesus...
do i?
oh, my god.  is that true?
why's that?
isn't this technically a scooter?
i overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. i he thinks she's the killer.
not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
about what?
what about--
in a couple of days this whole thing --
damn you, long!  my people are out there! your people are out there!
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr. blaine. i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, dr. jones?
sometimes, i want to blow his fucking brains out!
that's right, fella, no hearst paper will run an rko ad until you agree that citizen kane will never see the light of day.
when i drive it, i feel like i'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  i don't hear anything, i don't feel anything.  i figure somebody else is driving.  it's a bitch.
not this boy... i ain't fighting their war. i got my own. right chere. heard tell you're a good man to know.
to get me killed...?
that's right. she will get fired. in fact, i want you to send her back to paris.
oh, yeah...
i understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
what about the girl?
where's ratan?
i don't follow...
<u>i didn't dump you</u>!  get it through your skull -- i just recast the part!
hairy ?
is white meat all right for you, mr. shea?
no.  i didn't.   i'm listening.
of course!  not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  rent a uniform!
with how many people?
*                     we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  the second amendment types'll love that.
sheriff buddy was a different story. long as roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. that sheriff wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
name one.
the police are after him, he's a murderer!
i was getting to it.
no... i mean... i mean look at these. i've got to lose weight, i'm a blimp.
she's fine.  please--
if you have some, i'd...
why did she never tell her daughter?
does cole know about this?
yeah, i really cleaned up on him.
he's my brother...
like so. there you go. okay, hit me!
i have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
you want me to burn my book?
pretty shallow of you.
i know.  he was to take the fucking money.
if we could just eat first.
no.
what honey?
indeed... may i offer you gentlemen anything?
this is boring, guys.
jennifer can stay and look after kevin
yeah, i'll do you a favour.
what?
jud, why am i doing all this?
right, del. del was one hot salesman. of cars. he could talk anyone into anything.
dr. royer-collard? may i be the first to welcome you to charenton --
yeah, winesburg, ohio, was never like that... but i got something that just might cheer you up.
oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
no.
i'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
the minute i saw you. i said to myself, she's a weaver.  have you ever used a loom?
honey, just leave it.
yeah!!  i talked to andy kaufman!
you shame yourself.
well of course he wants out of hell! the whole point of hell is that you don't want to be here!
but... wait... there are things to say.
magda!
you don't sit with me!!
fucking chick's married.
mrs. simmonds.
answer the question. you knew sidney's mom?
nobody noticed. don't worry about it. we'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
program name?
doc -- something you said the other day --
your last chance. take the money.
now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  you're just gonna have to pick me up later.
maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. just make a clean break.
must've read about the funeral.  sick mother.  that's the last thing you need right now, i'm sure.
thank god.
why wasn't the ship protected?!?! why was it sailing without radar?
oh hudson, i was worried you weren't going to drop by....
yes.
he's totally unstable.  he'll make a mistake.
why?
you only hurt yourself you know?
what the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? you lookin' to get shot?
why not do it in the colosseum?
eric!
go in there and lick his attitude.
sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. it just gets moved.
they can't convict us of that. you proved our innocence. besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
what assistant?
not exactly.
if it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
....i'm not exactly sure what that means...
no. he's dead.
i can't tell you like this.
hi.
it's worse. i think there's something going on between cecile and her music teacher.
what's wrong?
do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
but she <u>saw</u> us.  i could feel it.
where're they headed?
don't make it difficult for me. this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
i'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
no, ernie's is fine.
mebbe.
i'm not going to close the--
want another?
i've thought about you.
ugnh.
suspect's words -
absolutely.  i suppose everyone does.
i'm going to get it for him.  whoever the mole is, i think goes by the name of job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the noc list, he'll find me.
you keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
massive subdural hamatoma.  we have to evacuat it - right now.
no.
mind if i smoke?
oh i see. you got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
i was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  so do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  you held on as long as you could.  yes, everything did go wrong, starting with hal. i mean, what was he doing up on the tower with a girl who could barely climb?
marriage can really complicate things. so, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
i had to smuggle it in here. i guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
i kind of dropped them off.  they were getting on my nerves.
keep straight on this road here.
go to hell.
you know i am.
larry? we've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for vp, treasurer and secretary. mr. hendricks and i have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
what?
she's one of the sick people?
hate to disappoint you.
what were you yelling about?
he's big, hutton.  you never saw anything so big.  watch yourself.
okay. go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
how old are you?
where is it touching you?
..it seems we have a problem, dmitri.
icey, i'm worried about willa.
and he says, 'yah, that guy's dead and i don't mean a old age.' and then he says, 'geez, i'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
i doubt it.  who's your friend?
what're you gonna do? strong-arm me?
god forbid. you're not sick, rose, forget it. don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
one moment, friends, let's give the senator a break.  now, where'd you say you studied law?
same as an hour ago. remember? i'm the steady type.
the experiment. the danger...
yes.
i got a hunch, joe buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
oh, what?... your servant, sir.
from what?
i don't know.  a hundred, hundred and fifty.  how many miles is it from colombia to miami?
capades? they don't do it. mittens? outlawed. why?
please.  sit down.  we'll drink some scotch.
well, it was good to see you, daniel, but i have to be going.
we're all assholes, bernie?
what is with you tonight?
i'll be out of touch for a while. just get to the airport.
thanks for taking over.
he's not in this class.
how many?
damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. we'll get those new routes to pittsburgh and boston and the equipment we need. we're gonna compete with the big boys now.
i won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, i suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
you shouldn't think about things like that.  it'll just make you crazy.
you're kidding. you wrote a song? is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
we had a deal.  no one touches the gold until we're out of here.  no one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
max?  what are you doing?
he got hit by a bus.
do you?
samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?

just one. the back up.
you mean you haven't asked him yet? for christ sake, thelma, is he your husband or your father?  it's just two days.  for god's sake, thelma. don't be a child.  just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  tell him i'm havin' a nervous breakdown.

no.
i told you to shut up.
someone's coming.
so.  we're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the spec-recon training.  it may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
det. bradford, i'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
excuse me for a minute. be right back.
no, but would you think, from that one sentence.  that i was going to see it?
we found a bottle of dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  it was filled with water and cocaine.  mr. marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  i believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
well. if i didn't come to see the play, i wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
we're wasting time.

this.  whatever it is.
you don't seem like the type who does business with mr. shreck.
because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  see most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "aaaahhh!!! aaaahh!!!!
you're gonna pay for that, pebbles.  what?!
i'm not following you --
you want something, darling?
sugar or honey?
i love you.
all we thought about was coming home. i swore i'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.

where do i charter a boat?
you're lint!  you're a flea!  you're a blip!
shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?

i don't know.  he is the stronger one.  he has a power--
a shadow.  what's as big a castle?  as light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  the shadow of the castle.  are there any buildings that have the name castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
hey, mick!
about chinatown. what went down.
jessica!  he'll drive there for me, and i'll drive to ann arbor for him. we're going to have sex when he's ready and i'm ready.  it's got to be completely perfect.  i want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
i got a call from a gentleman who's going to costa rica, or thereabouts. if he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  and very well-funded.
good. i fucking hate australians.
then tell me how.
long live the first amendment.
some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  maybe we should ask hedda hopper!

they're coming.  any minute.
i don't know, dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  another hundred for the tux --
mmmm.
like i'm responsible for all the smokers!
so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
the master is not yet married.  nor do i think he ever will be.  we are simply his servants.
just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
so from there to there?
honey ...
who are you? maybe i'll need to. you like me, huh?
you're joking...!
what's that got to do with it?

dorothy told me you were here.  i was going to telephone but....
... arrangements also have to be made for the v.i.p.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
hello, what's your name?
i may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
sir, i'd like to ask you a few--
here's a nice place.
just tell me what's really going on.  i think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
do i know you?
who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
we did a little digging on jim trudell at sergeant zydowski's request. he's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. what was that?
such a sad face... you know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
that's a hell of a thing to say. why, rose?
aha, just what i suspected!
are ye afraid of me wine?  did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the wee folk?  think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
this looks promising .. i think this one could be it?
i just think ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
what is that...?
no dances, just tell me.
hey, dudes... aren't you supposed to go to church, kenny?
how's your precious little school-marm today?
it's bleeding... i'm bleeding... my god it won't stop, i can't get it to stop.  let go of me, i wish you were dead.
a few words? i thought he was imbecile?
you merciless bastard!
i'm lucky they don't knock down the building. it could happen anytime. and everything worth remembering is right here.
sobek.  half man, half croc, oldest god--
now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
well you did it today.
i'm sorry, sir, we're not allowed...
i'll give them to you.
no, i'm not afraid.
as opposed to?
you'll back me up with some paperwork?  then i'll try. but wouldn't this have more weight coming from the senator herself?
she was here, you know, wednesday, and i said, "catherine, my sister..."
there is yet time.  don't you want your own pleasure?
well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
...at least that takes bobby seale off the street...
not for a long time, now.
you sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars i worked my ass off to earn?
you can't come back here... anything happens to you i'm liable.
on the contrary. gravity is foremost on my mind. look, i'm trying to make an ascent here. why don't you go pester dr mccoy for a while?
hypnotizing.
i'm not that sort you know.  i appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
when carla comes by i'll talk to her.  she'll make up some nice invitations.  we'll have them printed up.
what is wrong?
can you really see through anything?
don't thank me, just do it. you're the slots manager. i shouldn't have to tell you this.
he's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
and when v'ger melds? what will happen to you?

you're not?
dil!!!
carl heine came.
you know something about the human body, gray.
god, how i hate all this scrimping and squalor.
where are you moving to?
i'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
my poverty, but not my will consents.
car's gone.  we just missed them, that's all.
i see.  how much?
i got caught in the storm. you were gone all night too.
did you know that there was a <i>new york times</i> reporter there that night?
one chance to tell the truth, tommy. who is the man with the scar? he planted this in my car.
could be.
irving berlin.
i'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  we'll give him the shut-out.
who taught you be be a nurse?
it's bluebells!
we're never getting out of here.
look, why don't you and lila stay here and have your natural life. i'll just go on my way. you'll never see me again.
what's he doing?
steppin' razor a warrior. but this man...  ...this man stone crazy. surely, the mute is a false prophet. our paths uncertain.
i'm looking for someone.
just the same.
ssh. i'm on a stakeout.
<u>what</u>?
so you're from around here?
he's the assistant chief of anesthesiology, massachusetts commonwealth.  he says your doctors, towler and marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  and we can prove that.  what we don't know is why.  what went on in there?  in the o.r.  that's what we'd like to know.  something went wrong.  and you know what it was.  they gave her the wrong anesthetic.  what happened?  the phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
you see what they doing, those posts out there?  putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  we wait until super bowl sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  so we going soon as it's dark.  you want -- i mean it -- you can still come.
hold on.
whatsamatter with you?  aren't you concerned about all of this?
i've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
i kept trying to call you after my divorce and tom always said you were busy.  when i got the wedding invitation i knew you weren't sore at me anymore, godfather.
i talked with your father last night.
the door was open.
why do you think he took his gloves off?
why?
shut up and tell me.
there she is.  i got visual.
can't we move any faster?
a do-you-think-he-saurus. what do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
i told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! nobody's supposed to see you here! what if i was a mailman? or a salesman?
no way...
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. agent scully doesn't deserve this.
he is at that.  no so much a fault of his own.  poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
i hope this prick doesn't run.  my knees are killing me.  stay behind me.
i'm educating myself!
listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. isn't that enough?
me??
peter, let go of the chair!
what don't you do?  randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
well, boo-fucking-hoo.
you can touch me, i won't bite.
colonel, sir, mrs. washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
please. dario argento is the ultimate master of horror.
she is married, but not to him. another man, much older.  she has four kids.  the young guy works for her.  and i think she likes kinky sex.
that's the experiment?  dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
what play?
of course not.  but it ought to be organized.  just an editing job.  you can find somebody.
you gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. then, if someone shouts "wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
go by yourself then.  where you taking me anyway?
it's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
yeah, you would.
from the beginning...
mm-hm.
question is, what are you doing here?
never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
but you can't.  we must escape.
there's nothing to tell.
you got a warrant for this?
i have no idea.
ticket!  what's going on?
it's getting too cold in here.  i can't stand this anymore!
uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, walter?
it won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, don sanchez.
still...
i...ahhh...umm...i'm thirsty.
it shuts off automatically.
androids... don't have...fun.
pentangeli's dead.  he was ambushed by the rosato brothers.  didn't you know that?
... the point is i know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
i sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. why can't i bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
this is just a test.  the big one comes later.  be careful with that though, it's all i got.
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard.
what are you going to do?
emily left me this morning.
i know.
who knew about agnes' pregnancy?
what point is that?
got work.  i know a man who's got a boat.  wants me to sail it for him.
i have a confession. when we met...
well, it you're not gonna ask, then i will. how was it?
just goin' up'ta "tops"... maybe the "ten pin".
you've heard the stories right?
what else did he tell you...
question withdrawn, you may step down.
some kind of animal?
i can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, helmuth. but i need something in return.

this is great reefer.
patrick, he's...
have you told your family?
no.  are you really going to drink that stuff?
i scoured the city for it.
well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
rich old ladies and their daughters?
two, two-fifty.
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
i thought you were gonna get one for me.
think about it.  how do you think i got in here?  did you hear any glass break?  did you hear a door splinter?  how did the evening end? after you went to bed did she linger a bit?  maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  is that what happened?
... he wants to testify ...?
oh, there is no hurry. tonight he'll be at rick's. everybody comes to rick's.
hi, mom.  how you doing?  here, let me get you some coffee.  that's enough of that.  what triggered it?
what do you say to him?
you're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  so stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
just being there where it really happened. it was different... more visceral.
it's time you found out.
and even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
the jacket. that's what they call it, right?
could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
after the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on site b.  we had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. and they did.  for four years i've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now i want you to go there and document them.
what are you hoping to find inside?
jesus!  can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
so what's the point?
ben franklin's going to paris, but i think the french will be long on talk and short on guns.  our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the british?
hi. can i come in?
that was the idea.
no.  that wouldn't be fair.  where are we going, jerry?
madeleine --
who is your friend?
and so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  he couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
no... i don't... it's just... oh god, billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
what's he do?
no. it's one of the few times i feel good. i used to have to go to work and cook every day. that i got sick of.

this time...
excuse me, wolfi. mama is not feeling very well. can we leave now?
is it dead?
the refrigerator?

i don't want to take up your time now, but i was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. it's a security level three matter and information retrieval records says to refer to you.
will i see you again?
i don't know.  you've got two people in there already.  it could get a little crowded.  i want you to close your eyes and relax.  now i'm going to speak to dana and i want dana to answer.
the hebrew hammer! you're alive.
think back about what she said. exactly what she said.
high school... remember ? run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
how are you protecting your depositors? by making a lot of idiotic loans!
don't confuse what we do with who we are.
but, doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
they're crucifying you out there.
who says i don't like you?
what does that mean?
was that your chapter, then?  it was very good.
longer we hang around down here, jack, better chance there is either glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.

amen to that, brother.
vera... you and i have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  i like you... very much.  i was thinking that maybe.

what happened to his wife?
let go -- he can't -- !
she's too genuine.
paper.
see you later.
what's the matter?
is this national security stuff boring you?
the hell you call me?
he helps administer the charities now, and i give him a reasonable allowance.  he has no money of his own.  i know how he likes to present himself; father's weakness is vanity. hence the slut.
even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
not one bit.
no, i seriously doubt that pony's gonna be in a limo.
if you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
i know.  still thinking about retiring?
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  where did he come from? who is he?
what?
anything you want, boss.
you and dunbar got your stories straight. little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you. you think you're just going to slide out of this? you're an accessory to murder, levi, you're going to jail --
does it have any favorites?
apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  i read the clocks. they bear out hasslein's hypothesis. we've been away from earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  still can't accept it, huh?
you sure you don't need any help in there?
good morning.
her doctors have. jamie and i. we're still praying for a miracle.
and then what happened?
non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
an accident.  no one was hurt.
i know just where to go.

i'm not going in doug. i'll wait for you here.

clarence, i've got something to tell you. i didn't just happen to be at the theater. i was paid to be there.
now you're being bright?
why? what's wrong?
i'm sorry, george.
what's he say?
no...nooooooo...shoot me! shoot me! shooooooooot meeeeeeeee!!!
well, i was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  there's a lot of money in there. lot of money in there, and i'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
i mean did he take you up to his room with him? did you go to a hotel?
what'd he say?
what're you ... ? where's sarah? where are the boys?
shooting at maybe eight feet. i can't use any lights.
you should write something about this.
ah, i'd sell that. start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...

i'm mad at you.
why didn't you call for back-up! what were you thinking, jesus!!!

i have got something for ya. well, for your boy, actually.
i'm going to marry the woman i love.
i'm going to the bank and i'm getting my jewelry too!
are you alright?
fuckin' walking around with a big head. you better check yourself...
do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! for cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
so who is this <i>choko?</i> is he your new boyfriend?
donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  are you clean?
you signed for five years --  so four years, seven months.
how's the trip?
eric!
well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
for what, the cops?
oh.

certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
so what do you want with her anyway?
n-n-n-n-no, no, i du-du-du-didn't, i didn't!

between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
narcissus, i have your family. they're alive.  all of them.
oh, couldn't you say something? you have to slither around behind my back!
flesh is a trap.  that's what he used to say.  flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  why did you come back?
they're so untidy.  i'm just trying to rearrange them.
how could i expect you to tell me something that i wouldn't even tell myself?

thirty-bucks?  that's it?
where... where are my clothes?
a word of advice my celibate friend. these czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. right kat?
stop worrying, deke. she was in a boat.
there you are! barnard, you'd better get your things together. we're leaving.
i knowed your daddy.  and do you know what your daddy said to me? he said, "tell my little girl pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
sure i can't twist your arm?
i got you.
i love you.  how many more times do i have to say it?
she's tired.
you're through with one night stands?!  what do you want?
how did she die?  i wanna know.
don’t you believe in simplicity?
well, you're the worst pirate i've ever heard of.  you're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  what kind of pirate is that?
what was it?
jesus!  we have to get you to a doctor...
no, no, no...
i beg your pardon?
dad, i watch those reality shows. they never let anybody go. any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. this is our chance.
some good ones.
of course you would. if ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with helen's father.
what about the toe?
only respectful things.  what did we have in common back then... what kind of music did you like... did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
i know what a hologram is, captain. the question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
let me go!
alfredo, did you know my father?
the key?
local 8 just started in penns grove. and, bob said he was at fight club in newcastle last week.
why not?
because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
ah, mom.
i wish i could live in the shower. i'd take five a day if i had the time. i went to this spa in germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. and the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
katharine!  oh dear god, katharine - what are you doing here?
you gotta let me bring you in to the police.
i think it's be better if i was alone.
be quiet.
you have to. it's a tradition.
the traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. they got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
dead! oh no! that's terrible! we'll never get rid of the damned thing! what are we going to do?
what are these people?
see you downtown.
oh, yeah, i forgot.you still prefer your cat to the real thing.
how about you lovey? come on. let's you and i play a game of honeymoon bridge.
faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... we have ogg's gifts, the key and the --
okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
that seems so far away from who you are now.  what happened?
come on.
why me, man?
then what'll you do?
i can't leave my job, george.
don't mock, hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. don't do it for me! do it for the paper.
well it's more than loneliness. hate. people hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? i'm all screwed up.
there's nothing to think about. either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
hey.
what are you doing?
you're part of my flock now, john. welcome.
wanna try?
i don't know, i guess i never really thought about it...  is larry here?
ed concannon.
is that right, rambo?
but then you told her you were home.
daphne?
don't you gamble?
who?
okay, whatta i do?
we go back.
no!
love them so much that they ought to love you back. only you want love on your own terms. "
there is not one thing funny here.
you okay?
why? hi, karl.
thanks lloyd.
i don't want to be buried alive. if i die i want to be sure —- quite sure.
no. no way!
ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
no.  no.
what are you making?
...so that which is good may flourish
is that right?  can't say as i blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  i know i've had my fill of this town.  sixteen years i've been the law and order here.  so long i forgot why i ever wanted the job in the first place.  help people, i guess.  keep the peace.  problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so i can't hardly blame them.  other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  i reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say mrs. mckenna?  a murder?
i told you what i want.  lock the door!
am i too heavy for you?
where did you get the news item?  from a little bird?
no, never!
there's a question. whether they stopped bein'. and when.
does your mum and dad know about tony?
maybe we had a case of that here.  get me my kit.
and take a little trip with them...
look, eric it's your little friends.
you won.
how does that help me?
no, no, no!  you got it all wrong, potato head.  buzz is fine!  buzz is right here.  he's with me!
an aryan warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
seven...
you got any kids?
what was she to you?
you're not capable of it.
uh-huh. he's the, uh...
i can't feel it now either. the mother must have gone in.
all these years you've kept those things buried down here? in our own house?
i got a confession to make. my name used to be heather, too.
what'd you mean ib bangin? what kind of name is ib bangin?
then why ain't he dead?
it's them.  they did this.
i think i've lost my mind. i think you're not real. i think i'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
oh... my... god!
it's illegal, nick.
put more into it!
er ... if ... we ... er ...
i'd love it!
let me go!
what you say?
hope i'm not interrupting...?
my girl back home. we're supposed to get married after i get my wings. she was tommy's girl. they were engaged to be married before he died.  i should've told you about her. i don't know why i didn't, except i didn't want you to think i was a shit for making it with lynette.
there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. jack and i can get off safely. both of us.
if i needed your i.d. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, i woulda killed you to get 'em too.
listen to me, johnny. come in! you're out there all alone... we're getting close... real close... maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
you know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. good suits, good food... the underworld of the underworld. a grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... i like that. i like the idea of that. these days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. it's all take, take, take. you can't just be fucking witty about it.
you have to put yourself out there a bit more.
yes.
which ones?
actually, i was a wonderful father.
now wait a minute! this business about spock  and mccoy... honestly, i have never understood vulcan mysticism -- i'm sorry! but part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... understand?
i know what i'm asking.  your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  you'll need cash to buy information, and i'll provide it.  i feel responsible, mr. welles.  you saw what he did to her.
help yourself.  since when do you smoke?
i want you to quit.
my dad's an optometrist.
i couldn't resist them.
oh, is this adele?
by telling you this, i'm trusting you more than i trust most people.
okay, okay!  okay.
texas is a big state.
has anyone seen greg?
when was he... created?
hi, santa claus, how are you. he's with sears, i'm with wal-mart, twas the season...
'every week by forty million people. i am a respected journalist.' have you won any awards?
so... we get to shut down the neutron reactor?
oh. 
what for?
it's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. that voicebox of yours is a hoot. say "i'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  you do know you're evil, don't you?
shit!  he jumped!
hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but i'm not in this for whooping cranes. i'm in it for cowgirls. if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. i want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
a million flat.
did they disconnect testa's computer?
somebody loan it to you?
then how'd you hear it, fool?
i thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  they don't let everybody in.
how do you feel about snakes?
you okay, miles?
-- as the keeper of the archives of krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
george, i went to the doctor.  i don't have two years.
we worked for that money.  we were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
what's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. and i'll be seeing her again soon. only what will i say? that i was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? that he's down here laughing?
she's going to help you understand what makes sid 6.7 tick.
what about us?
why?
and you never even suspected? never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
are you alright?  what is it?
two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  baked or fries?
oh god, it's soft -- it's moving!
yeah.
same one.
london.
that's not a question, is it?
i swear to god.
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
very sorry, but you see, no rats!
okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
and don't go getting everybody lost out there. you'll give us a bad name.  you won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
<u>jack</u>!
do bullets really bounce off you?
oh, honey.  there's not much to do there. i mean, it's all work.
roy dillon?
no deals! just information. information. free of charge. no strings. just information.
why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
as far as i know, he went back to his parents.
what the hell do you want?... hey, sue ann, what's up?
shut down?
the old man saw an owl. over there in the dry wash. last week.
that had not occurred to us, dude.
yes.
what did you just say?
a man in a suit with a slim build. tall.
i'm sorry i got you into this.
you don't know where your mother is? does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
huh?
thank you for your time
even my own wife, chief,  who's wondering where i am?
benjamin -- what's happening?
jones isn't in his room. miss scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi --
he!!??  how dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
what?
he's lying.
you didn't?
i do -- and i think you should too.
i say we don't call it in.  under no circumstance are we to call this in.
yes.
what of it?
great.  so what are you guys working on?
the same, alas.
mental instability?
how'd you know my daddy?
he's seriously disturbed...
i don't get it.
but... but, why?
i was.  so?  mr. pecharda let me in. as you know, with all my responsibilities i often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. but i left very early, around 6:30.
maybe we should call the coast guard.
yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, sally, i sold this transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
i...do you want me to leave?
i've read official estimates but i wouldn't bet my house on them.  i've heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers.  at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
i don't know.
cut out my heart! throw my liver to the dogs!
but he's dead.
god, it's wonderful to see you. where's greg?
no, you didn't. they found william starks' body dead in the snow.
okay.  good.  goodbye.
a what?
well!
i told you - it's a sure thing.
know what i think?
if i could feel like you feel...but i have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
what i'm thinking is, we can drop down through tennessee, across arkansas and into texas, from there it's a straight shot into california.  "we don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
the hell are you fiddling with there?
yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  they couldn't go doing everything at once.
what are you missing?  riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. that shit is sadder than ethiopia.
okay, i'll take it all.
i'd like to begin.
well, if you could just come for the day. new york's only a few hours by plane, i'd have you home by dinner...
it can't be a coincidence.  the woman that owns it has a son.  she says he's been on vacation in montana for the last ten days.  we're trying to locate him.  there's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  we're checking that out too.
you think we need a new jail?
i just gave up smoking.  a last drink?
you know about lo?
the quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  a faerie festival over a pile of bones?
i'm glad you and the general didn't have to leave us. we would feel quite deserted..
you missed the last three, including her birthday.  your wife's gripe sheet.
i don't wanna say over the phone, but i think we may be chasing the wrong man.
what did they say before the bad card came up?
you thirsty?
no. but thanks.
no.
these guys're good drivers.
evening. table for one?
and we got rid of the red head.
you want to dance?
lenny the loser.  panhandler of stolen dreams.
i do <u>not</u> like you.
i'll send you straight to hell, fuck!
i had a father who knew how to steal.
washington and holt.  dance club called "fever." know it?
impressive.
planes mostly. may take a crack at rickshaws. how does the direct approach work over here?
and then --?
holy shit.
where does dickie live?
it's s'posed to happen, biff.
i'm with two friends now.
no.
he won't let me in my own house!
could i ask you to move?  i'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, i can't really bear the sheets moving over me. sorry.
cut the horseplay, harry. what's the matter with you guys?
yes.
yes, they are.
i'd like to see your pictures some day.
thanks.
forging signatures. telling lies. impersonating practically anybody.
he's a good student.
what's wrong?
where is she?
if you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
he's not a loser at all!
why is that?
which means he probably knew her.
hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
i'll call you mark when you catch the killer, detective.
it doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
yeah. fuck it, dil.
what do you suppose they're saying?
i know.
i'm getting treatments right here.
fine, louis.  we'll stop in for a drink.
you gotta help me. okay? this girl i told you about? diana? she's from the five towns. she's jewish. she won't go out with me alone. can you believe this shit? she's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. she's never been out with an italian before. she says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  you believe this shit? but you gotta see her. i mean, she's beautiful.
mrs. rand...
he hired you.  that was a mistake.
... nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
i bought it in a pawn shop.
the club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  i want to try someplace different.
a toast?
wait till you see her, auggie.
sergeant, i'm a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
upstairs? chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
are you all right?
eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
what is it?
you people...rich people...
i'm right behind you, blue leader.
this damned tie ... will you help me, edgar?  churchill used to say to me, "if you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  all right, edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
morning, darling.
can't you stop that?
oh, fuck, seth, that's my only pair!
we can't wait.  no matter what sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill pop.  you have to get sollozzo now.
let me tell you something, shelly. i do what i'm hired to do. i'm...wait a second.  i'm hired to watch the leads.  i'm given...hold on, i'm given a policy.  my job is to do that.  what i'm told.  that's it.  you, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark i'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
the papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, curtis zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. do you believe that?
no, i see betty as a midwestern stoic type. ice water in her veins. a clear thinker. probably a swede or a finn.
you have to pay attention to a girl. be sensitive to her feelings. relationships are reciprocal.
tell me about the girl.
what were you saying, stanley?
what are you doing?
it was -- it was -- it changed shape. first it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
he didn't have to hit him. it's not exactly like i'm sleepin' with the guy! and he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! what the fuck is that all about?
why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
i don't think there's been any debate.  there's no debate...my mistakes....
no, three thousand at least. he'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. that's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. he'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. but he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. but i wouldn't count on it.
daddy?
before i met your maw, god rest her soul, it used to be i was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. only she made me see the error of my ways an'... i ain't like i was no more.
well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  it works.
it's a bloody navigation hazard. one boat can't control a ship that size.
goodbye, grady.
what's wrong.
just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
go on, major.  you fascinate me.
peter, i'm an agent.  i buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  that's what i do.  you're a writer.  you write pictures. that's what you do.  and trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
yeah.
just in time.
good luck, genius...
i didn't ask you about the list, i asked you your name.
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
we're on a truncated time-table. take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... and we're still going to need to expand the crew...
more denunciations?
i'm sorry, cole.
what're you looking for?
thank god, austin, we made it.
you don't understand.  about seven years ago we found the body of a guy named vasilnic in jersey.  a week later in the parking lot of madison square garden we found iman fasil. three days after that luman castageer was found in an alley.  the fourth body we've never been able to identify.  all four men died from decapitation.  nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
you're doing fine, ich.  now drop it, okay?
you need to understand, and i - i'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
at a press conference.
it isn't lit yet.
what's funny?
turd-burglar...
from a to z. all you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
...you can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
they're my kids.
why don 't the zulus attack?
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  it'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies.
what's going on here?
i was in the sixth grade when that show was on. i totally dug it. what the fuck was the name of the chick who played christie love?
you figured this was a set-up? and you showed up anyway?
it's private.
heather, why can't you just be a friend? why are you such a megabitch?
they did.
a man to see you.
right.
you couldn't. you've never been out there, you said.
well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
i am going to get my nut on this trip, miles. and you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
it's as smooth and slick as oil.
he doesn't give a damn about me.
oh.
i've been trying to find you all day.
says me. do you dream often?
dent it a little. boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. she had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
the man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. he lost control and is capable of doing it again.
you better keep a low profile for a while.
... i'd like to focus on my career - - now than i can, now that everything's all right... parry's taken care of... and... like i said, i feel like i know a lot more now and i don't...
quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! my scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
okay, sounds like you're all set. just clean the pipes and it's a go.
i've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
i can't see anything.
grow up, heather. bulimia's so '86.
how ya doin', mookie?
i was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  your mistake, if i may be so bold, was promotion. commanding a starship is your first best destiny. anything else is a waste of material.
that's all you're bringing?
no.  fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
his movie nut mind has snapped, sid. he's gone psycho.
stay in the light! everybody! stay in the fucking --
at least i don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. i don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. some bar. christine'll understand.
hello, charlie.  long time no see.
that's his headache.
oh, i know.  a fleur-de-lis party, right?
somebody broke in.
how much damage?
listen to me good, evan...
stacy! i've got water in my ears. do you have any q-tips?
i'm sorry. i thought you said --
it's just as well. i'm afraid of getting hurt again. mark seemed great at first too. i don't want to get too attached to peter and then find out he's a creep.
need a hand?
she's calling the shots now.
when do you want me to start?
you put explosives around the habitat, i can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
to be a mother?
it's just i've got those parent conferences, and i'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. and shopping for ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
what's the matter with you?
my suitor?
come on, will...
the rosato brothers have performed services for you in the past; i understand that they are under your protection.
where's gilbert?
that's all right.  we have no secrets from our readers.  mr. thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, mr. bernstein.  he knows what's wrong with every issue since i've taken charge. what's the cable?
come on, get down!
i want to reach people.  nobody listens to me.  this is my way to reach them.
got any cold soda?
a little after-dinner liqueur, harold?
well.
delacroix, wake up, brother man. the reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and i mean nobody - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
we're split down the middle. if i held a vote i think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
the crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
i got a super--special birthday present for you this year. i couldn't risk you finding it, so i had to put them locks on the doors.
no way.
i cut it on some glass and we got lost, mama.
you think i'm a tourist?
say yes.
so how do i start?
he does, a little spot where the butter had been.
you're gonna be okay.
it's just not enough.
huh?
i know.  i know.  but i'm saying, if they knew.  we're going to be millionaires, man.  millionaires!
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  and surfers are territorial.  they stick mostly to certain breaks.  if we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the ex-presidents surf. you buyin' this?
yeah. it's my sister's.
good.
did you spill something?
take it to the next level. what are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? if he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. what is he thinking?
you what?
eli says you're a carpenter, book.
no, we're stealing.
i'm sure.  he's dead.
they're just simple tests, nan. we'll both be right here.
marry christmas.
...for three years?  let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
look who's back from the dead.
you can't keep me here.
and i guess we didn't talk about money.  so, i'll just dive in --
hey, jim, what's doing? uh-huh... uh- huh... jim, we've been over this. if you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. i don't like him either, but i'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. give my best to denise. bye.
because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  i can't believe you're talking this way mister detective -- i think she's got a lot of guts.
she likes this dress...
don't worry, dix. i'm on a roll.
well i got to watch myself these days. know what i mean?
what do you propose?
i can fix it.
...why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
is it drug related?
i was prejuduced by those achievements.
and then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
it looked like a fuckin' gun!
i'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
they both have some growing up to do.  but they're good people, they're starting with love. they've got time.
again?
well, sammy's dead. yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
'stanwyk's parents, marvin and velma stanwyk, also of provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
there was a hurricane, bill, the wind probably moved it.
shhhhhh. now i have your disease.
what'll it say?
so much.
i have your fucking family.  don't forget that.
please.
hello, thomas... i'm chance, the gardener.
yeah, sorry about that.  i had this meeting with this guy.
this is years ago, before he joined special forces, i guess. we had an argument.
what?!
listen, it's important, ev, i gotta see him, i got my reasons, very goddamn important...
a complete surprise?
how?
got a problem with that?
hey, that's terrific.
it's your grass.
carcaradon carcharias. a great white.
hey, wait a minute, mr. doe!
don't worry. he was white trash, they come at two a penny. i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
jesus christ -- why didn't i know about this?
space for what?  to o.d. like that other kid?  i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  because it isn't.  correct?
yes -
i'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
well, thanks a lot.
yes, sir.  i hope you will excuse me for asking, general bonaparte, but are you corsican?
your ranch?
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation.
norma, this is bela -- bela, this is norma.  norma, this is tor -- tor, this is norma.  norma, this is paul paul, this is norma.
yeah, it does.
reputation.  reputation!
if we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, i don't mind taking you up on it.
i don't hear anything.
i'll manage.
no, mr. lounds. you'll be just fine.
y'know if you make it to the bigs you could still become the host of dance fever.  baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
if you want.
now, george! dinner's ready now!
can't do it.  i cannot do it.
more than you could afford.
who was that?
presence.
oh, that randolph hunt. you remember randy hunt, annie. he was in the choir with you.
no, you come on. take off your pants. i want to see you.
i think i already have.  but now she won't even talk to me.
if it's any comfort to you, i don't think you're crazy.
walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  it's your roll.
i can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>ghosts</u>.  i am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  my agent, bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>architectural digest</u>.  in fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>vanity fair</u>.  except you.
great.
cats?
what is it?
i guess so. you want to help me watch frank? i'm going to stake out frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
this is the last place.  shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?
i'm sorry.
beverly, are you alright?
what do you think?
so?  you wanted castro dead. everybody wanted castro dead.  if hunt and the others are cia, why don't we just throw this back in the cia's lap? let richard helms take the fall?
what?
i'm not that good at 'no,' liza.
i hope you don't take to bitterness, sister morgan. i tell you like i tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. no matter what the trial or what the misery is, i tell 'em to stay with god.
i'm trying to help you here.  there's warsaw, there's this --
his yacht?
i didn't notice his shoes.... did your mother know he was there?
so, i hear the tart from california shot heyworth.
i'm not eating alone. can i ask you a question?
sir -- we charged!..gentlemen -- and i hope you will quote me -- i cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp...
sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - records is a dead end department, no security level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
we're in negotiations, that's correct.
before the coma!
here.
tis not the time to speak of cheer.
i don't particularly like killing, tubby, but i want you to know that this one i'm going to enjoy.
forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
look he figured it out !
no hints, samuel.
don't pay any attention to him. that's his way and i've found he's sure easy to get along with. i don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and i guess i had it comin'.
absolutely.
you know...like restaurants, night clubs...
well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
he's gotta be in the forest. all three ranches run alongside it.
yes.
why?
i've got to stop and help those people.
somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. you've done your job, x, head back to prague. i'll be landing in 90 minutes. this is my operation now.
five-thousand per kilo.
oh.
a bit of one.
and what makes you think he's in this territory?
then for god's sake, harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
theoretically, yes.  but is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
hey, pal.  i don't know about you, but where i come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
not at all. the place is totally deserted.
how about a cup of coffee?
well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! they're playin' it as far away as mobile! the whole damn state's goin' ape!
how do you *like* this! you don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
once i thought the biggest thing i'll ever do was guard the president.
...we get our hands on him?
sorry. we got knocked out pretty quickly.
just for him?
and i believed you! i oughta punch you out! i oughta...! hey. hey, let's go huntin'! albert! hey, albert! let's go huntin'. what do you say? nick? what do you say?
yes, sir--big as life. been there some time now.
what?
i'm not...
queen of diamonds.
what are you doing?
excuse me, do you know if we've passed nostrand avenue yet?  excuse me.  look, i'm asking a simple question. have we hit nostrand avenue? i fell asleep.
sir, the press conference is starting.
who used to say that?
why? jesus! why me? why can't i wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? and why am i still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? worst of all, why can't i feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? why do i have to know, over and over, that it was you. you who died; died for my sins! and that i will die for nothing. why?
i'm going to say i'm 104% sure.
get the sedative ready!
...i won't go into that today. though, if we should continue these sessions, as i certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that i would like to look at. god knows, i've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...at any rate, i just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. i just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
no.... i don't...
oh, i'm sorry, trip. what you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. no offense.
yeah?
they couldn't break the riddle.
we've have to stop!
whatta you mean, forget it?
us is over.  you had your chance you blew it.
the baron is tired?
did you make me a tape?
okay, sucker.
that was a really hot house!
her car is gone.
i say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
want me to breathe deeply?
is that what it is?  dollars? money?  i'll pay for it.  take it out of my salary.
it still strikes me as, well, surreal, that i'm allowed to see you naked.
goodness, no. from what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
you thought i was mom?
it's not safe here.  the whole country's crawling with bandits and germans and god knows what.  it's madness.  i can't allow it. you're not, this is natural - it's shock. for all of us.  hana -
what the fuck?
a moray eel...a moray eel....
do you have any children with anyone?
and did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>what</u> <u>is going on</u>?
...just doin' my job.
you know, sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home. i'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
i saw you, i couldn't go in, i...just stood there wondering if you knew.  you looked...sad, and i had to sit down a minute.
the refridgerator.
dawson, sir.
you must be.  you have responsibilities. you must learn the rules.  you can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  you will always know when you are in the presence of another.  beware. but more importantly conor macleod, will be your battle against time.  in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  people will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  but life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  that is how the others exist.  nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  keep your soul sewed to the earth.  do not become one of them.
oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall i'm going to do everything i can to help you.
all i know is, ever since "glen or glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
i'm so glad you could come. here we are, all together again.
no cell.
two-thirty-seven:  "... and the descendants of japeth are these: obediah, zebulon, hezekiah..."
i'm late, i have to pick up amy from her afterschool but i want to talk to you about that hansen thing.
...he's two floors below you.
... i don't get it done often.
how long, dixie?
could i please have a little water?
my interest is in you, not in her. she seduces people, she manipulates --
charlie and i were talking. that's one reason i wanted to see you.
absolutely.
smoking is bad for your heart, michael.
it's me.
so.
well. . . yeah.
will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
incredible.
no.
c'mon, man!
case... yeah, miami joeboy, quick study. how you doing, kid?
i was. what are you reading?
oh. the green underwater ghost's...  the man with the eyes in his hands...
sometimes... once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  they have so much they want to tell. but they've never had a sympathetic ear. they need someone to understand why.  stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  it was part of the ritual. some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  but these last three... they were still in water - always in water - but  listen, he wasn't just careless.  it went beyond that...
what do you say to that?
will he talk to me?
not an option.
where're you going?
mrs. teasdale, i'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything i can to make up with his excellency.
you're crazy.
only everything...
it's useless...look at him.
two p.m. great. bye-bye. 
no more... i can't!
here, you try.
i need to ask you something, mr. nelson.
you're a dead man.
i'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. there we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
see what i mean? it's a funny business, isn't it?
look at me.
that would be me, sir. the wife made stew last night.
you're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
what's there?
i don't like horror comics.
pheasant.
and why would she do that?
then we'll go home?
how do you send out an apb on a dead man?
but why didn't he just follow her to fiji?
well, maybe i'll surprise you.
this is a castle. and we have many tapestries. but if you're a scottish lord, then i am mickey mouse.
scar! where's he holed in?
see, i'm going home.
well who did?
what do you want with my baby?
yes, prince mishkin, what can we do for you?
williamson...williamson, they stole the contracts...?
wow!  that's neat.   can i sit in it?
don't let 'em off the ground.
what makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
mommy, please don't call me that.
oh my god, that was good. where'd you learn all those new tricks?
no...i was hoping to get a kiss.
have any trouble getting here?
i heard him say it.
why are there still such headlines?
you mustn't see her, my lord.  we know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from lorraine.
of course i like women... i love 'em.
yeah.  retirement?  paid sick leave?
what are you lookin' at?
for you to fall in love with me too. listen carefully. every night, when i get off work, i'll come and wait beneath your window. every night. when you change your mind, open your window. that's all. i'll understand...
nobody is freer than when he dreams.  i read that.
of course he did. he came on to every attractive student. which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
that's very clever. do you know any other poems?
a hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  and now that i'm being forced to give it back, i intend to return it in exactly the same condition: a barren, lifeless rock.  the gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless british government who wouldn't listen.
i warned you about playing that shit when i'm in the car.
why does god let there be bad things?
i just hold it loosely with both hands?
hardly new news.
hi.  didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
because, my dear will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  have you seen blood in moonlight, will? it appears quite black. if one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
i don't know what's going to happen to us logan but --  are you glad you didn't kill him?
there's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with julia wolf that the police have overlooked.  and i think it explains everything.  you see, my father was a sexogenarian.
i'm worried, ray.  it's getting crowded in there.  and all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
might wanna fasten your seat belt, jack...
what?
and that would be morals. that would be one's own moral sense of decency.
it sucks.
she sound scared?
i'm so sorry!
i've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  it seems to be metabolizing.  he should wake up soon.
may i have your coat?
i'd better get back now.
never mind—i'll get it myself.  gigolo? why, you took the word right out of my mouth. thanks.
county. i was in for fraud.
i had to -- for all i knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
where is your daughter?  she might be able to give us some information.
peter lassiter...
well, how'd you get here?
it's like the basketball team.
what about transportation?
you afraid of these ...?
i just has a terrible thought...what is this is all a dream?
i capture quebec leading an army by river fordings through maine... if we don't do it, the british will come down champlain, take back ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
charlie...
okay.  i just thought as long as it was paid for --
you're a beautiful woman.
what do you mean you and my father decided? who the hell are you to plan my life? let's get married and live happily ever after. bullshit. i got knocked up. i had to marry you. i never had a choice.
oh, i'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. i mean, you know, i think that it'll be really nice to meet mother and father.
small bed. maybe i should sleep in the barn.
i thought you were going to help carl.
nah. you just relax. how's the book?
are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
that's a pretty big margin of error.
so what if he was?  it's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
he ask, i give him anything.
how do i square the accident?
you're right.
you tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
here's this dog that tried to eat me. here's my motel. here's the car i rented...
bigger?
walter sobchak.
boats.  all anyone talks about is the wind.  is it up, is it down.  i can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
how about a little game later?
does the queen live?
your valet, sir.
call me.
father, are you okay?
well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
sure. cheating, lying. what's a little werewolf a few days a month? we can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
inga!
do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
scoundrels? they weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
what happened?
you know. the stuff i left.
what were you saying, governor? sorry.
well, mr. gardiner, that's just fine with me - i'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... be seated, please, mr. gardiner...
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  what is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
...if i had your looks, better.
yes.
terminate ?
i hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. i am a ...
it has entered earth orbit.  correction -- it is not in orbit. it is heading directly toward the surface.
but do you agree with me?
crabtree? he doesn't even know james.
i don't.
well, herr inspector! how did you find the camp? crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
i'm in position, scarecrow.
the shooter local?
you know what those leads cost?
i'd just like to know the true versions of things. events. stories. you.
sorry. another client paid for that. you can hire me not to use it.
what am i, an ass?  when you called me, i called elkins, and her bosses. nothing she saw is proof of anything.
tell me, just what you know of dr. meirschultz.
i don't know. just some messy little scrap. you know that bullshit.
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. i handed it to him on a silver platter. i told my father and those people...
you remember me?
see that, son? now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. someone has been walking here.
-- a sense of proportion.
what a place for them...
i see. so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
feeling better, oz?
what the hell are you doing here?
i don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
i am not interested in what you would rather; i want to keep going. i am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
by who?
he, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
it's just money.  you should be glad you're alive.
well, for one, i read. i don't watch as much television as you. i'm trying to feel things more. i'm learning a lot about people.
... i don't know.  probably not.
i have no secrets from my family.
permission to leave, sir?
of course not. here's the fruit cake.  and you want to see my knee? 
alright, go crazy.  let 'er rip.
you'll have a corpse on your hands! that what you'll have. i won't eat a thing while i'm on this boat.
i've moved into scotty's... good news about t.j., though.  looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
no.
yes.
i started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
the last few days, um... i've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  i want to tell you... i'm starting to understand why you left me.  i've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... i want to apologize, for all of it.  for shutting you out, for not being there.  i...  anyway, i hope you can forgive me.
i wouldn't do that, fettes.  i wouldn't report it.
right.  tim mason.
lots. it's got balconies and two big towers.
food-storage room!
i think you're exaggerating.  and if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
i... i can't do this.
okay...take your time...i'll...i'll go for a walk around.
who?
how was the flight? they take care of you okay? long way from norfolk, isn't it?
i am dr. norbert woodly--a physician, a healer.  i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
i've got to stop.
well, it's the least i can do.
i don't get the humor of that remark.
this is sweet!!
i'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
from the magazine?
so do you like your new room?
whose funeral? we're doing all right. there hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
you wish to close this account today?
jesus.
do i have any other choice?
<u>where is reed</u>?
away. from you.
you're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
maybe i jumped the gun.  maybe those cowboys aren't near as bad as they're painted.  you know i was thinkin', there's a lot of money in the cattle business...
no. it's a mess.
he's out by the pool right now.
1 just did it for the reunion. i thought it would be fun.
i think you should sleep closer.  i meant for safety.
yeah, i guess so.
when did you get back?
you didn't say find them. you said, "get them."
joe, you're making a terrible mistake i can't let you make.
he doesn't make sense to me either, chewie.
we'll let you know.
no thanks, i'm not thirsty.
there are six hundred people down there. we'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  the son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
didja ever go to the top of old man larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
you get mugged or something?
so you did meet her?
i wonder if you do. i wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
remove your weapons, commander. and come here - alone!
maybe caen.
tea.
damn it.
you wanna leave, man?  let me take care of ganz all by myself.
-- actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named ramblin' bobby holt. when i turned twenty- one, i went to europe with visions of being free and independent. my luck, he was on the plane. i landed in paris and fell in love before i could claim my baggage.  we were together for almost a year. i thought he was it.
so what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
we don't have any proof of that.
he had girlfriends!
not until i get that beta cam back! we're both in a world of shit here!!
no, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
imf mainframe.
just say yes! nothing else, just say yes.
i tell you once again -- surrender!
what?
i don't know if that's going to happen.
don't worry too much about that. margo just doesn't miss performances. if she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
you're a police officer. a very nice one--but you have a job to do. i'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. don't go considerate on me. i might start to bawl.
you're a very nice guy, and i don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
don't go in there.
you look so... i don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
what about them?
nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  huh?  we're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  the worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
sort of...
give him the card.
goodbye.
you closed him yesterday.
what is it? are you ok?
what do you mean, they won't come?
guess.
i would've stopped it.
hello?
you'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. i've had a very unusual life.
thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  i will be back. an hour, tops.
so you killed them?
you really think so?
i don't have your number.
i think you're crazy. don't look over, it's lenny silverman.
well -- professor barnhardt, i guess. he's the greatest scientist in the world.
yes?
that why you moved from the last town? 'cause you were in trouble? you can talk about it if you want to--i know about it anyway. routine check.
you mean, we're stranded down here?!
did you call the police?
can you cover me for an hour?
okay...that would be cool sometime.  how 'bout tomorrow?
nothing.
so whenever we want...
mighty decent of you, pal.
lovely.
we'll see about that.
i wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, david -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
working.  charlie and i were going over some statements.
that's puttering, sir.
a lot of what larry says is true. they just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
you know, hildy, i sort of wish you hadn't done it.
gerade aus dann links!
agnes. what did your mother do to you?  if you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. did... did she hit you?  did she make you do something you didn't want to?  did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  did it embarrass you?  did it... did it hurt you?  what did she make you you do?
how can you tell?
yeah. do i have a case?
clear the bridge, captain...?
yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
airk!  come on, airk.  lemme outa here.
you mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  i can't think of anything.
you know, you've been acting like this ever since i went up to see my brother at mankato. i told you, nothing happened!
whoa, elizabeth. a little hostile, there. maybe you should be the one in therapy. then mom and dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
it's funny. there's probably been five more cars stolen in the time i've been here ...
this guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  wait.  use the frosted glasses.
darcy?
well rose was being very thorough.
don't shoot yourself.
no... we're together...
i'm not!
hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
look, chris.  there are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
your timing swallows the massive one. grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss don, and we can't do shit.  don't even ask about those discs. goddamn that art mooney with a star by his name!  it's tied to johnny's c.d., i know.
okay, what the hell are you up to?
--see?--
if you think -
what's happening?
come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
look, i'm genuinely sorry...
what is it?
but now... they are all one with the borg.
she had a moustache.
hmm, i still owe him.
are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
are you crazy?  i have no use for a woman!  since my accident.
there's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in caen.
what...?  do i have so many already?
-- merely in the interests of order.
so where's all your stuff?
machines?
pregnant, is she?
you should keep track of your old school chums.  turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  on top of which, she's lucy angstrom hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "studio one" on cbs.
yes, what?
not at all. i've come to pay you a personal and official--and i might say--a *tardy* tribute, mr. smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
my name is...
what is enough?
and your coat.
yes!
and all his works?
i <u>am</u> sure. look, murders aside, riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame. he loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. and you're playing right into --
if you want.
you fool, what have you done?
we are interested in this case. have you arrested the girl?
what's the problem?
this is cheery.
when you said you'd let 'em go i thought she'd come running right out for sure.
who are you?
i wish to discuss your brother.
no.  you two are the most important things in my life.  i don't ever want to lose you.
i'm not trying to break any records. i'm doing this because i enjoy it. not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
if i went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite i wanted. untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
earlier this afternoon, the emperor refused the hand of the grand duchess anna, of russia, and, as i'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  for the emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, i've sworn off playing poker.
well, you never will again!  thanks to vitamin c! i'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of vitamin c every day.
you know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
oh - excuse me!
how'd you manage that, then.
wilson— yeah—  yeah— i fought wilson.
what's the next step here, jerry?
no.
wait a minute. wait a minute. so how did it happen?
good lord, fella! i'm talking about your boss.
you're such a baby.
how do i know you're not lying.
oh no. i'd wait and see what happens with the ritalin. i think that's the answer. wait two or three weeks.
is there someplace we can talk?
people are expendable to bodhi.
what the hell?
they're burning all the canadian stuff cause of the war.
look, i know you're upset.  i'm really sorry, honey.  i raced home as quick--
thanks.  a lot.
i don't want to leave you.
it's your decision, maria. i don't want to high-pressure you.
have you any idea what the message is?
may i help you, sir?
but you suspect.
my fellow americans. i have led this fight in the war against profanity. i have founded mothers against canada.  our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
david.
you're too young to be studying criminal behavior. it's making you obsessive.
why aren't you at work?
i'm not dyle -- you know that!
i listen on the radio. i can see the games just fine that way.  the world is in your head, remember?
who is she?
we're going to die.
you don't know if he was really gonna --
i am in charge now. get back to work or i'll fire you.
so go take your job on wall street.
i don't want the -
doctor, always try to do the right thing.
yes—if he is your husband.
the serial killer?
i don't know.
fuchs...?  no, it's not fuchs... you must let me back in... i won't harm anyone... i promise...
what about dinner?
i thought you were out of town!
he was?
got a license?  but no car?
you’d better get going. my parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
...pardon?
never.  not with me sir, never... listen, i think i'd better go.  i said enough.  i said all i'm going to say. 
not actually .... our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
you broke my nose.
but if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
oooohh! a fruit cake. thank you, mrs. sutphin. have a seat.
the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
-- what?
i had to sleep fast so i took two allergy pills to help me...i'm sorry...hey, you called me.
guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight. now he's gone.
plus to minus.  negative to positive. male to...
i'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  and i have to get home to my family.
don't worry about it.
oh, i don't expect it to last.  i'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
all right, what's your husband's first name?
a famous actor who's getting married next week.
don't start again. if you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
promise.
no, but i'm goddamn thirsty. ice water?
molly, of all the people... if i can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
what was that?
no!
very important, garland. i just thought you should know that. whatever happens.
so you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
take her down to the car, and for christ's sake be careful this time.  last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  what a mess.  why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
no reason. because you're leaving, i guess. i don't think you were there, were you?
it's possible.
i'm sorry, nicky. i didn't mean anything by it.
you fuck for money.
forget those two clowns, heather.  answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
thanks, charlie.
and you still reach for your piece every time.
define small.
please revel with me, aramis, i need my spirits lifted.  i'm old, i'm weak, my strength is gone --
oh, it was...  really weird. but she's a very nice woman.
oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  promise!
about?
we can't raise the wheel without it.
the wasps were meant for michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  the great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  why would you hurt him...?!  answer me.
dysfunctional --
that's good. that's uh... good.
scratched --  we did not take the initiative.
was that okay? i mean, was i able to... satisfy you?
i don't hate white.  i really don't.  it's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
we're on our way.  alan-one gave me the coding we need to go up against master
i don't think so. they've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. but sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
two packs a day.
are you sure?
i've never felt better in my life. when do you get off work?
she's got no fucking pulse.
do you think there is any life up there?
oh, god!  oh god!
okay.
i'm tired of this game. please play without me.
beaumont livingston.
did you sleep well?
why?
...but that's two hundred dollars. this is blood money...
shut up!
what's it add up to you, sefton?
finish yours?
yeah. ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
what do you think?  get us into that room.
i plan to have a stroke from the amount of msg that's in this food.
things change, kundun.
the good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
nicole?
you think he killed her?
i didn't speak to him, sir.  but colonel "bat" guano was in command of the special service battalion, so i would imagine he did.
allright. i admit it: i'm prejudiced. i don't want to work with a homosexual. you got me.
why, mr. conway, you surprise me!
is this a fuckin' joke?
if i don't move, i can't shoot it.
i'm going out for a few hours.
and the more you tried, the more i wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. and how you suffered... i need your forgiveness, louis.
i didn't. but it's a three-way tie between the stooges, patti smith and the runaways.
can you fly that thing.
no...what?
will i see you tonight?
obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
a what?
they have nothing. in fact, they think it's drug related.
i'm proud of you.
your line of work.  you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
and much richer as a result.
i really was way way too too.
not this twig, friend.  i got plans.
i can't find that thing in my car, i can't find it so i'll just get it and give it to you later. so?
it's all about sisterhood. everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
shut your mouth and drive!
i'll be right there.
how long until he can fire?
oh, ellen!  i've been wondering when you'd come.  why don't you step in.
sir?
you get it yet?
he says you are very sad ridiculous man. i don't agree of course. and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. nadia is a prostitute. i'm sorry.
how many?
it'll be okay. i don't think you should wait out here though. i think you should go home. can you drive this car?
quickly, close it.
in the navy, we used to call guys --
i was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  that i'm happy today.
the nurses leo and me picked up last night. we got a date with them tonight.
...the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. and no doubt god'll be pickin' on you on judgement day...
this is one-way street.  you go down the block to the middle.
was there blood?
slower! in... out...
mr. president!
the ghost is close. he almost got us. buddy is hurt.
i'm sorry.  thank you for the party.
oh, very much...  ... i used to work somewhere in that direction, i think.  a huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
we're looking for mike.
and what do you propose? that we knock this guy off?
do you really believe me?
so josh...
yeah, well...  so when are you going to get your job?
well, i don't want to brag, but i've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- i just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
nigel, get out of here. and don't come slithering back. nigel shakes his head.
all right.  whoever she is, i'll admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do.
they're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  it's their nature.
how'd they find out we're going to mexico, thelma, how they know that?
good. more coffee?  robert, i hope you don't mind my asking, but i feel like i should.
why - er - mrs. teasdale - this is an outrage!  this man is impossible... my course is clear...  this means war...  you runt!
stop it!
i must say when i first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in bombay i never thought i'd be greeting you as a national hero.
i got here as fast as i could. where's cathy?
don't be pitiful.
he knows you're aware of that.
i'm fine. can i go up?
long wait for a bus?
i just saw him. he's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
thank you.
good.  you've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, mr. kramer.  how old is the child?
oh lookit that brunette.
yeah well why should i suffer for that?
i'll stay here also.
just of getting hurt. they can't touch me inside.
you don't believe in suicide.
it's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
what the hell was that, another statement?
we only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
don't need none.
yes?
everybody has one like that.  i thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
you want to take a look at my car?  i think the radiator hose is--
pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, i guess.
oh, yes.
what're you talking about?
no...  that's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
i can see her.
you are not a loser.
i feel like he's here. horrible. like the old bastard is here right now! that's brilliant! how do you know him?
what question?
alvy, i...
i didn't say it was a bad idea, i just said the timing was off.  we could maybe wait till later.
get dressed. we're leaving.
if you don't mind, you fill in the names. that will make it even more official.
excuse me, are there any more claims?
geometry?
not likely, convict.
what the hell...
is it true?
you're not. we're level. look at the instruments, we're okay!
i bet you did. i was never bent that way. i'm bent the other way. so, you liked it out there in the world.
ready?
hey baby...
well, i'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
way ahead of you, wyatt.  you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan.  everybody knows they're the ones to blame for your brothers.
26th off wilshire.
it was my idea, grandma. i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
that's alright.
i don't...i don't want to bother everyone.
i...liz...all i ever wanted, was for you to be happy. i just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...i just love you so much...so much...
of course you shouldn't. you don't know how to do it. dunking's an art. don't let it soak so long. a dip and plop, into your mouth. if you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. it's all a matter of timing. i ought to write a book about it.
how'd you know about the fire?
so you're doing all right then, eric. you're making good.
we can send a message to starfleet command -
all right!  i get the picture!  i'll do it!  i'll testify!
why not?
eventual supernova.
no, no, no, no. you can't take him away now. this is his night. won't you introduce us, wolfgang?
oh, he was dying for years.
why do it?
oh, man, did you see her? did you see her?
well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than i bargained for.  i just wanted to set the record straight.
really.  what'll i pin this on?
i had not the slightest inkling.  why didn't you say so?
he's just mentally retarded, i guess.
no, you don't.
he's probably very tired. you see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
it's a promise?
oh.  okay.
i left it at work.
all right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  okay?
how come i can't remember?
how about canada?
there's hope and promise in it, jabez -- planting and promise of good harvest to come.
cue music...
miss, would i be prying?
how are you?  how're you feeling?
go on, fetch.
you're startled?
this dispatch has just arrived from aboukir, marked highest priority, for general bonaparte's eyes only.
what?
how many men are working with you on this?
don't do it!
you - wait! you didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
she had you tempting fate.
that's a good one.
you lasted eight years, as orderly, in dr. lechter's prison ward.
he's in tachycardia.  george, your heart is racing.  have you been using drugs?
moscow.
i hate you!
damn right, i have. you think i like living on fucking yucca? we do a good job on this, we're in.
i want you to kill for me.
three things. first -- you don't have a choice. second -- i've never taken a bribe in my life. and third -- i'm still a little drunk from last night, so if i skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. tell me about the two guys.
no need to rub it in, mr. grady. i'll deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here.
yeah...look--
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean anything.
what in hell is that?
oh, sandro...
christ, you scared the shit out of me.
someone's falling.
do we want insurance?  i'm just asking...
no!  i keep seeing him staring out his window. watching me.
why would they want to find out? we're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. why would they want to lock us out?  and besides, they'll never find out. all you gotta do is keep changing your job title. like, uh, from casino executive to food and beverage chairman. and what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. i know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
it wasn't you.  it wasn't personal...
call my secretary, she'll set something up.  factory looks great, folks.  keep up the good work.
what?
off limits.
...wants a piece...
holy shit, he's a toon!
how about us? is that the truth for us?
ya kiddin'!
we should go.
we're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
i knew this whole place'd be pure gold! pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! if i can get something bizarre enough on tape, i think i can parlay it into getting me some kind'a robert stack "unsolved most- wacked-out home videos" gig. no more five afternoons a week of sex-change- nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
...just that the witch is so wicked. i don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
wait, fred, what about your thing, you know... "digitize me, sergeant chen!"
the ten dollars.
scooby?
pretty lame for such a smart kid.
things pretty tough for you at home?
she had these real beefy thighs. delicious.
jesus, you act like you're seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
i'm rambling. i really like you. you make me want to talk... i don't know what time it is.
yah, okay. how's the hotel?
for the database. it can be accessed by every casino in the country. we have the same system for punters.
no, he's ruining yours.
the father. the father.
the witch?
i met him.
i swear to god. in a very quiet voice.
was he the president?
well, girl. you tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
but what about major houlihan?
see you tomorrow —-
do you want to get some coffee?
look, it's not a big deal! i can fix it! all i gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
tub - but i-tub - but i vol - love but i love ui - you. i love you!
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
this clear moon's house?
the president has been murdered.
that doesn't matter now, henry.  the point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
uh ...
that's the reason.
that would be great.  it better help.  what can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
that was isla nublar. this is isla sorna. the second island.
so, i see you're really into spooks.
yeah.  you look... great.  i mean it..
no, not that, no...  i mean this, the whole thing. start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. get a boyfriend like this. tell me the truth.
i was in the basement fixing the pipes.  would you believe that?
i understand, michael.  but you must make a family, you know.
what?
"the mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>although</u> it is altered..."
she was alive all these years... you never let me know her. who gave you that right...?!
you'll be designing monuments soon, albert! hotels! palaces!
madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
but?
what are you talking about?
did you call anyone?  did you call her house to see if she got home?  did you call the masons?
her sister's going to do that.  she's as worried as we are.
when he was alive. i wouldn't fuck him now.
like some vile toadstool.
tell me more about cabot.
i'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  i'd like you to get your stuff out.
it's all over, paul.
where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
and tell corrado, too, that i'm here... if he wants me. you can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. is that clear?
i'm not ...
where?
leave stephen out of this --
you rich?
too bad about frank, isn't it?
now, mister gi...
and now...
i thought he was a kind, gentle man?
they couldn’t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
you drive a black bmw, license plate srk1339?
a couple eggs and juice would be nice, mary.  over.
the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. i had a good man -- an excellent man on the rue ponthieu, but h.q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
i couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
you're so wonderful. the jewelry's not so bad, either.
you haven't heard me.
fuck you.
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
what was she like?
the governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. two days ago!
what the hell?!
how were you sick?
what the hell are you talking about, kaufman?
walker and williams.
i'm sorry if i've ruined your day, mr. reynard. but my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
no -- it's --
me, i'm proud to be a jew, i got no problem. you don't like it, fuck you. but with these guys it's like a dirty word. all they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good american and a jew. so sam goldfish becomes sam goldwyn and david selznick becomes david 0. selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's irish for fuck's sake--
so what are you gonna do tonight, marty?
the cloak invisible. it was my mother's parting gift.
dr. milo, please don't call my wife mad.
why didn't moe green meet us at the airport?
play?
agnes, how did your mother get you?
i'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
i've got a situation here and --
deck four, captain; officers' quarters...!
1,000 kellicams, closing!
maybe i don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but i don't work the same way.
i'll be in my quarters. execute course to the federation boundary.
but she does work here?
i ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... remember like i say, i found you in the road...
and what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
other way around, sir.
more time...shit, she's had 400 years...
who's left out there?
shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
how is she?
the phone's ringing --
why, certainly -- but be careful, mr. scratch -- medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
mr. mintz.
why won't you answer me?
huh, i doubt it...  friedman only deals directly with select customers. i handle the rabble...
if you wake first, wake me up.
when you won that scholarship, i was proud of you.
this cannot be.  everyone knows the queen mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. stuff like that, you know.
hey. what are you doing?
johnny!
yes. i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house.
allright it's closed!  jesus!
yeah, you know holden caulfield in the catcher in the rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
sure thing.
your name is al...
okay, baby. now you outfitted. you ready to tackle the street?
no, no.
what are you talking about?
who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  when he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and i want it to bleed for me.
yeah.
really?  great.  still "remaining men together?"
why didn't you bring him?
oh...
mrs. mulwray, do you love your husband?
m'm, that was so nice. that was nice.
no. he's either very smart or very stupid.
well, i mean...i wanna be on tv. maybe have a talk show or something. like conan. or early letterman.
can i join in?
it galls me to watch you. you can do as much in days as i can in years. men like the 'the dreamer' are protected. out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
the mud carriers.
do we know anything about him?
come on, honey, let's get out of here.
do you remember when i was a kid and i had those blackouts?
oh.
or you can let him knock himself out. you personally'd be sending him to his grave.
sam!
so? the man got silver, china, rugs --
so.  do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
where you been all day?
what do you want?
he doesn't look very threatening.
i've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
jesus.  data-base hoods.  it's a wonderful world.  beloved daughter missing.  reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  dead or alive.
if i can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
what i mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
so how 'bout it, mr. selznick, do i make my deal with bo? or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
...this is the crucial phase, the reconstruction of pigment. cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. that means growing skin. clever, eh?
no way. no thanks. i can't do it --
it's going.  it's going.
mr. galvin's...
yes.  i think you probably can.  we'd need to talk about your fee.
-- i don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
hello.
i don't know why the fuck we're having a party. the damn job's not over yet.
unlimited energy out there.  enough to run this world for all eternity --
you'll get a heart attack like that.
you should have. i don't like leaving things unfinished.
i'm duff.
i need your name and address.
what did i say?
listen to me -- you men and women --
yeah... yeah.
you're bettin' on an inside straight this time. you'll never pull it off.
look at that place. it's creepy.
szpilman.
you shouldn't laugh at people. it makes them feel bad.
this is my old friend carol.. i told you about her.
damn, lena...  who is he?
it's ear-marked for mirror man and the sphinx...
what??
you're dead, you're fucking dead elias!
ok, roger. here's the stuff you wanted. files on horsefield, tudor, swinburne, and velakofsky. papers published by hobbes, linsky, and lefebvre in a couple of issues of the bulletin of the canadian medical association and also the journal of the american medical association. and, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files i helped compile before your time here, doctor. i thought they might interest you.
there's a few things you don't know about women, brother malcolm. they're possessive and vain.
all i've heard, from the day i met michael, is julianne this, and julianne that...
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances.  his name is lee.  and he is to be shown every courtesy. within reason.
yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
you still pretty upset?
did you always want to be a lawyer?
yeah, it was awful.
you'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
where can i find buzz fazeli?
no!  i mean... why so soon?
so where's the best place for mojitas?
if she comes over here, max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
don't be so amazed. it's a very ordinary matter. i'm jacqueline's physician... mr. ward told me you were in town and jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
i ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, i'm givin' you reasons.
well... to be honest... i'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when i get nervous i'm not myself and i'm afraid i'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure.
this is overwhelming, john.  are these characters  animatronics?
um...i'm pretty sure i'm bruce wayne. and you are?
you take this.  i ain't hungry.
then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins and their descendants!
i was going to say... your eyes look a little red.

you know what it's like, agent kujan, to know you'll never be good? not good like you. you got good all fucked around. i mean a stand up guy. i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything 'cause i was a cripple. shit, i wasn't
funny.  would you like to buy me a drink?

but...you called.
say matt, i'll have to have some money for those manville payrolls.
frida, you know you're it for me.
i'll make it part of the class. we'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
well, here it's half.
p.d. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
he wasn't robbed.  he was identified by his wallet.
what do you think about?
together.
oh, i know you, nick. i know you real well.
sort of!
where did you meet miss lawson?
i'm handling it.
yeah, it might be.
what are you talking about! you make hamburgers! that is the point!
the sheriffs will take over when they get here.
figgers. there's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? deduct it.
and a house. valued at 350 thousand.
well, we don't exactly have a costa rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
that fish smelled strong.
i put blueberries in them just the way you like.
what happened?
come on. you're fucking hungover.
okay?
she'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
that's just what i'm sick of. everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! greedy for what you got. a bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
you lost your baby when you lost your balls you've lost your mind, you've lost your grip so say bye-bye
well, sir, they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base.
no. the fetus was dead. her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
always has been.
it's a really nice place you have. is the rent high?
donnie darko is a cool name. sounds like a superhero.
my kids don't have enough to eat!
i thought the books were blank?
look, this is serious now.  they're talking serious money --
fifty-five.
do you like me even a little bit?
bloody hell! do as i say!
it is not arguing to speak the truth.
brilliant.
what's he got?
as in 'resulting in death.'  we pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
eight-thirty.
you okay?
this?
my god, alice.
look, what do you expect?  considering how we met you.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... it's soo good to see you. how long are you here for?
number three.
hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
i'm sorry to keep you.  how can i help?
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
eric, you're not watching your mouth!
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
lois, someday --
well, he's taken care of. scratch one hot dog.
what?  <u>why</u>?
client?  i like to think of myself as more of a friend.  a mentor.
but you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
hey... you okay?
this was too important for the enterprise to be on the sidelines, admiral...
you're crazy. don't let him, peter.
i've heard the name.
ah, here we are. steed asked me to play a hunch:  valentine peel.
yes, but not because he's out of a job. that's not news! this man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
you what?
listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
why you? how come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
and what if i didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
why?  is he staying?
ohhh...
i don't get it. what do you do?
this'll be nice. we haven't seen any of the sights yet. it's history. when i was thirteen i used to love seeing things like this.
not unusual.
you don't like coconuts! say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? lookit here –– from tahiti –– fiji islands, the coral sea!
after all, mr. roundy, we're paying six percent. six percent. fha's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
you know how to box?
what are you suggesting?
what's this?
you make me sick, you fuck. once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
next waterhole's black draw.  we could be there by mid-morning.
my number two. special assignments. she's --
and who was the enemy?
she is an innocent.
i smell it.  it's here.
i want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
the baby i lost...
stop it. you are blowing a great opportunity here, miles. fucking maya, man. she's great. she's cool. she's funny. she knows wine. what is this morose come-down bullshit? these girls want to party. and what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, vouvrays? i mean, come on!
i've deactivated the sensory inputs. that flesh on your body is just meat, now.
and no one will know the truth.
i'm good at it. lying, cheating, manipulating... i'm good at it.
i'll call the police.
who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
i've got to tell ernie...because there isn't enough time.
you seem to like movies, detective.
i don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
oh, and your line to charles atlas in there: "i'll take that gun", "you'll have to".
sure, you have my permission. but i - i just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. it's no joke, you know? you gotta keep a low profile. it's not like back home. right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. and this sheriff's a real cowboy. even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
hell, he looks dead.
san francisco. an oasis of civilization in the california desert. tell me, do you share my high opinion of san francisco?
mayo, you didn't hear me -- i said i i'm busy! and so are you! go get cleaned up!
-- yeah, now lemme finish, i was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
who?
more... many more.
well, i'd better find patsy.  say hello to mutt for me.
i mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. i mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
they're fine.
there's always a chance they'll confess.
this is a setback.
i'm afraid i can't really let you through then, sir.
who?
i wouldn't pay jesse no mind at all. she's just a crazy old woman. hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  wasn't much right before that, neither.
if she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
could i trouble you for some water?
mrs. schuyler is not at home.
thanks. thanks for seeing me, at home.
you're so pale... i hope you're not coming down with something.
mm-mm... mm-mm...
let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a peter kurten.  we could use some help on the phones...
don't even think about it.
it doesn't have to be true. it just has to be good.
...so i guess that's it, then.  here's the keys -
is there no way they can get back to you?
okay, let's hear it. i'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
my wife.
i love you.
i heard you talking. hasn't rose come in?
sometimes i paint.
we've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  while the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about truman himself.  no scripts, no cue cards.  it's not always shakespeare but it's genuine.  that's how he can support an entire channel.
we do.
you're not looking at me, harry.
hi, jonah.  sam.  and who is this?
i mean, mr. green was so nice to me. he took me in and...
what's your name?
it's a bloody funny thing. you know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  it's a bloody funny thing.
uh, yeah, being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
tina, it's dawnie. i'm  on my way. cici follows her back into the living room.
i know. i just do.
ask what you can do for your country.  that kind of thing.
there was not much blood, was there?
no.  i have children, grandchildren too.  i visit when i can.  but now that mr. jimmy cannot be left very long, i do not get away much.  poor mr. jimmy.  there is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  very sad.
affirmative, arctic warrior. what type of vessel?
well, yah, but he had a buddy there. he, uh -
your father doesn't like me.
what happened?
please, i must get out here.
what about you?
it's a nice day.  how about the beach?
she's right, norbert--go home. woodly i haven't said all i have to say.
you're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man i know.
you're shitting me!
wrap it up.
pritchett: what is going on?
you think it'll send this guy back to hell?
if you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. you should learn how to keep a secret.
right, sure thing.  but what about, like, appliances?  like a little color portable?  boom box?
yeah.
are you ready to put him in?
what the hell are you doing here?!
i'm sure we could find a country and western station.
i let her take a shower.
is he? yeah, i thought so, too. i tried to laugh, but i couldn't. it stuck in my throat.
then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of everlasting despair.  now are there others?
it's not a contest.
want some help with that?
must be exciting, beautiful place, beautiful people.
gotta go?
so do i.
did marylin end up with money?
can you recall no melody of mine? i was the most famous composer in europe when you were still a boy. i wrote forty operas alone. what about this little thing?
what a place! how'd you like to walk acrost her?
where were you?
here, i didn't get any.
you do not want to be here.  go home to your father.
why?
spock... did braking thrusters fire?
what are you doing?
wait! first i give you special fuck!
you'd better try to get some sleep, bob.
how would you like to take a little vacation? i mean you've earned it, you know? you deserve it.
how much skin and stem contact?
he was only doing what he thought was right.
it was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
this floor's freezing.
waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. having no clothes on? that's insane. what did i do last night, alex?
okay. let's catch up. you go first.
fettes -- where is fettes?
looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
my brother's killed people, i know he has. truckers. if you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
i'd better collect my family first.
i can't sleep either, lately.  a little link, between us.  but bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and i'm dying to disturb it.  that could put a strain on our relationship.
i'm not really dressed for a party.
josephine dead -- how unbelievable! how impossible it is to believe it. she was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
how was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
nothing.
what's your name?
you don't seem bothered.
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
that record company.in nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
it's different for us.
go home, clay.  we're closing up.
janosz?
you want to make it like this? 
static is right! the radio's static, patton's static, we're static!
my employer requires your services. one job. one day's work. very dangerous. i don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
they're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
and you like that?
indeed. just a moment - as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him. a very appropriate person to do so. yes.
i am king arthur and these are the knights of the round table.  whose castle is this?
no sir, the hotel is full because of the diving championship.

"for excellence in the pursuit of truth."
m'sieu laval, madame would like to talk to mademoiselle gautier for a moment.
very early in the morning.
could we have a word?
feeling better?
you've known me five years elmer. when do you get to calling me david?
twenty-five, thirty -- what's the difference? -- it took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
jesus, i don't know...
that bitch from...
we caught another kraut alone in a back lane.  your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  that's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  the face turns a curious shade of avocado.  i must ask the doctor why that is.  at any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six krauts who were carousing there.
of course. they would like you to appear on the show tonight. the vice president was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
no. i haven't.
nick?... i just want to say how sorry i am about sal and about merle. how... i know you loved them and i know it's not the same. i mean now.
wait as long as you like.
so, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
they're dead in the water that morning. four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. and that evening they issue a general sos.
hey, i don't believe it.
well, put it down and come in!
didn't know you was workin' here now?
he's sittin' by the phone -
the money isn't here.

the holiday hotel.

which part of no don't you understand?
want me to drive?
a dime, terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
he knows who you are!  he's afraid!  i can tell!
what did i fuckin' do?... in the middle of the lakeview.
you got a bet on the game tonight?
this case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to washington. your old boss is coming out.
i'm looking for sid.
not true.
is it okay?
adam, your bozman building is a beauty.
is mr. fazeli in please?
i don't ever see any of you precops down here, i'm not in trouble am i?
i recall distinctly the detonation order. my memory is good on matters like these.
arthur.
i don't know. i didn't see those on any of the other girls...

we live two piers over, don't we? number 12, right? we're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
where can we talk?
here you go, enjoy.
are you in the middle of something?
they're whispering.  i can't hear them, but i know it.  i smell conspiracy.  i feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
"where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever."
dead.
she laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... she said she wanted to be friends.
oh, a jedi master.  different altogether.  yoda you seek, yoda.
stantz?  you okay in there?
fred krueger.  he's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  he needs me to get out of his world into ours...he's gonna take me again.
i suppose you want a cabin.
frank...frank sullivan.
isn't this getting kind of pathetic. i mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. let it go!
last time might as well've been the first.  i remember all the times, don't i.  watching her grow up --  in increments.
that's not true -- where are you--?
you going to eat this?
i remember him.  got in a car crash or somethin'.
why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
chief...it's like none of this exists. i'm sorry.

it's finally over.
ha! ha! now go back.
my name is harley -- secretary to the president  i've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is mr. klaatu.
honda 250, huh?
you don't have to do this. we could just cut out of here, go to akron,  or anywhere else.
a marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
i'm interested in long-term expectations.
you just did an incredibly brave thing! what you should have done was land your plane. you don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. i should ream you out for it. but it just doesn't work with you. you're a hell of a flyer. you are maybe ...too good. you never really stepped in it yet. so this is your chance. i'm gonna send you up against the best. they are better than you. maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. maverick hasn't really heard anything but topgun. he snaps out of it.
it's the game, arcade.
it's my graduation gift from daddy. it cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
say it not lightly...  do you know its meaning?
i told your wife.  trials aren't always so much about actual truth. as about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. that's sad.  and it's real.
ummmmm, look, i...i...
who are you calling, sis?
you ought to stop this nonsense, loretta, these two dollar bets.
you don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
he said he'd try. try is like maybe. try is nothing!
liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
i don't know what to say.  i love you.
oh <u>okay</u>.
no pain, mr. kringelein?
they requested her. it was her gig. max put me on as a favor.
well, it worries me.  i want you to get swept away.  i want you to levitate.  i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
uh-uh.  not yet.
oh, how sweet! you made friends with a nerdy girl.
john. how much time?
it might be too late already. what are you waiting for?
you think we'll ever come back?
how long you staying?
take the whole lot. i won't need it.
i'm a lawyer.
why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
cindy, i've been thinking about this whole friend thing. i never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... i mean, there's ray, but he cares for me in a different way. you know, bringing me flowers. running my bath water. and then there's nights i wake up screaming and i look over and ray's in my bed. holding me. and seeing that tonight might be our last night together, i was thinking...
what about neddy?
i can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
yes.
i might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell i was a gentleman. they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
so you made it.
shut the fuck up, all right.
do men have sex with each other in that theater?
i can't....i can't....
wait... what the hell is this...
i absolve you in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit, amen.
that maid saw us.  she could identify us too.
he said don't go nowhere. we'll be there some time tomorrow.
for your information, mr lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing leon is capable of getting into all by himself. though i doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
i got scared.
here here...
oh. yeah.
come on, lee.  stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  there must be something you want.
yep?
so that's it, just forget about us?
rose, can't i see what the nipple on it is like?
say!...what happened to your blanket? lose it?
jack, are you really dead?
yeah.  you never know who's going to be next.  okay, spats.  report to the sergeant- at-arms.
raise 300.
what? -- who? -- whom?
can't tell if you don't say please.
of course.  i was going to be james bond.
we're fine, sir. it will take some... time to explain.
i mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. what he doesn't know won't hurt him.
fuck you.
knock knock.
exactly where is she?
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  you.  what do you do and what should we call you?
what's the difference?
yes... i... i agree...
it's an art book.
look, it's not your fault, okay? it's me.  it's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
why would sidney want to be with steve? she has her own bubble-butt boyfriend billy.
i was attempting to get in the spirit of things. i thought it would be humorous.
maestro.
carrots.
okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  you come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. you go to tobacco... tobacco is a sales culture. market and sell enormous volume. go to a lot of golf tournaments. the hell with everything else.  what are you doing? why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
why not? i'm not charging you for the time i wasted.
what was that all about?
well, uh...
he's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
it's alright, i guess. you hear from anyone made it out of b.a. alive ?
i say when it's over!
sir, we're being hailed.
maybe if i just explain what happened, i wouldn't have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
what are you doing?
the truth is never let them seeya sweat.  you do that, that's half the battle.
then i don't get anything either.
that won't be easy, my friend ... what brings you here, anyway?
didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
well, i don't know. the week started off okay, but then i was outside watering the plants, and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect, so i went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
what did you see when you entered the house?
geez, gates was killed.  who do we send the thank you note to?
our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
you want me to take you somewhere?
you better be careful, seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
so, what's next?
where's charlie?
ohhh, i hate this.
nothing.  it wasn't anything.  i've been on edge lately.  maybe since the accident. and i'd prefer, i really would, to just--
could you seal it over with hot pitch, clive? caulk it like the hull of a ship.
well, let's wait for the x-rays.
is he home right now?
why did you break into that particular building?
he's gonna kill you -- !
i got lots of presents.
i feel like driving. are you terrible hungry?
what?
jesus christ, larry, what the fu-- larry. that's not even your name, is it? what's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
hello?
i know it's crazy, louise, but i just feel like i've got a knack for this shit.
is there only one charles lampert?
you mean it'll be difficult.
i'm alice. mother said you'd be on your way. mrs. peel with you?
what did you say?
twenty-five more'n i got.
you want to stay here, while cuervo jones rules the world?
it's on the tenth floor.
you know goddamn well what i've been doing--i've been sitting here suffering. i need my pills.
your friend's all business.
she's heavily sedated. she'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
you want to see...
somebody couldn't wait until dark.
alright... turn around. she doesn't get shit, unless i get that money. where is it?
you ain't got a chance in hell. you need threads and glitter, baby. a front, hey?
i'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, roy!
somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information, so on.

i gotta show you jason's grave.
the day he died, eduard was called up to the castle.  did you know that?
why always like this?  only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
thank you, sir.
my name is jeanne.  my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me.  i would like to have it back.

it doesn't matter how i feel about it. it's how you feel about it that matters.
mafia warlords, diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  a nice little rat’s nest.

what's going on? let go of me! stewardess! i'll never fly this airline again!
i don't have a pistol.
sandy has a girlfriend, clenda ... she's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
more'n likely.
not anymore.  surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, clarice. crawford dangles you before me. then i give you a bit of help. do you think it's because i like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
the letter from john doe.
how is she?
i'm going to live right here.  as long as i have to.
who will tell them? you need me to tell how you helped the hotel. the others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. they say you led the massacres.
those trucks. i know exactly what you mean.
it has come to be...  the four horsemen are drawing nigh!  the time of the prophecy is upon us!
i saw. i saw that big one  hit that police man. saw 'em drag you off too.  they take you to jail?
this must be it.
no.
we're doing hearst.
you're a lucky man.
what are you running from?
i was.
you're not going out right away, are you?
i know!
need some advice, huh.
you've been recommended by the management here. they know your father. he has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
the kiber crystal.
you'd make it. he's just getting to the girls. come on, zack. i gotta see my family, man. i couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
it took you long enough to get my ass out.
who is this?
flip.
the door must not be opened. the barrier must not be crossed. don't go on, doc. no matter how much you feel you have to. there's more power here than you know.
--- and i have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
so, how did your conference go with gordon?
yes, don't worry.
we've got to find out what it is. can you handle that?
over there! two more of them!
you've been well?
i'm busy at the moment.
with good reason.  they fucking worship you as it is.
how do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
his mother - we need her approval.  but i'm not worried - because i don't smoke.
i don't know...
well done, lad.  stout heart.
something happened with marty and ray--
you promised me!
wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. you see the way evan's mom was looking at you?
maybe i could start you out.
the same man who tried in nevada... hyman roth, not pentangeli.
you make friends quickly, don't you, clark?
who, levi --
you supposed to be a wounded vet, motherfucka. what you do in 'nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
it wasn't serious.  what's your problem?
you're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, stu. - where are your pants?
you--  standards and practices?
yes, sir.
jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? impatient...
sometimes i think i do.
why do you need to wreck this company?
i was doing my job. at the risk of sounding egotistical, i didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. i was chasing tail all night--i was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "brock leviathan, architect."  i can't believe he ordered white wine.  you do know white wine is not real wine...
let's see -- you got a minute?
perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach.
i don't know, kyle. you're the fucking expert. now get out of the way!
the zoo. they have a pretty good one here, do they?
do you see the maintenance panel?
i was working for you when "us" started, what's--
marmite - addicted!  baths - not with other people!  islands.  your handwriting.  i could go on all day.  my husband. almásy nods.
report.
you do?
i don't like your following me.
i'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. and have him check you both.
such a pretty day.  if i live to be 90 i'll never tire of mornings like this.  mind you i'm 74 now.
next saturday?
you dead yet?
alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
i said she's been missing for-
at least now you -- and i -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
in-in... alvy, in my dream frank sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and i can't breathe.
m'sieu laval, there are several things i've wanted to ask you for quite a while. i understand you are from marseilles.
spencer's doing fine. so what are you saying, that you're frustr...
i...
what?
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. unkillable.  but now i believe that is going to change.
shut up.
whoa.
and what's he do?
listen, bren-duhhh, i think you're the one overstepping boundaries. you're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. besides, who cares if he's married? i can have friends who are married.
do you have music up there?
let's follow 'em.
take it, man! you're all right! hold it in! guard!
at last i find you.
we assaulted a federal agent.  we killed him.
how's it going?
dad, didn't you say you needed prunes real bad?
well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
you still interested in that?
your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
i suppose.  it's very expensive.
like hell you ain't!
good. the boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
the whole world thinks you're underground.
do you?
maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in jamaica. all you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
if i'm ever in new york...
shit, i forgot to call her back.  she's off on a trip somewhere.  oh god, my grandad's flat in london's been sold.
you see, wilhelm, i'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. which is why i want to discuss your private life.  how many illegitimate children do you have?
that's right.
constantly. without doubt. and plays the lute, she has a natural ear. and her bosom--did i mention her bosom?
hanna?  who's the new yardman?
i love you, jez.
cousin eugenie, my father, but...
...go through with this? what are you going to do?
you say she killed a policeman?
you're avoiding the question.
did they give him special care?
but, how many innocents rot here? and, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
fuck that nigga. let him go woof on some other scrub. we got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
hey, where you been?
you got his hands.  beautiful hands.  i didn't even know.  that night.  when they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  life's like that. grows right out of death.
no, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
what happened?!  jesus, connie, what did you do?
anybody we know?
what do you think?
jeremy would have never killed himself.
what's the matter?
what's going on?
hey, it's me. no, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
like a real sister?
if i fail, you fail.
are you the leader of tis group?
somebody was in here.
hmm.  so, del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
how's he doing?
what are you doing here? i thought you were done with our family.
for once, to write something and have it realized completely. for once, not to compromise-
...these guy'll back you up.
she's gonna kill scotty!
good.
mr. preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
come with me.
coz he thinks you're a witness.
peace, everybody--paul, penelope.
i'm not asking you to marry me.
you're bruce baldwin?
get me wigand.
where...where am i?
what?
we made it?
a little more was taken out before.  my brother's a director of that bank, mr. mccoy... i had a few pressing debts.
betsy, can i talk to you a minute?
wait... wait... i already called him, i threw it away.
what gentleman, maria?
all i have is hundreds.
um... juno, can i -- can i touch it?
i can't believe the price of these fleabags.
were you on hop?  you were passed out when you got arrested.  were you hopped up, ray?
it must do something.
who?
wait.  i'll send a patrol with you.
i want you to get out of the water....
i think he's ready.
a word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? probably not the best time to hit on them.
give it over, dil --
i forgive you.
get in the car.  <u>now</u>.
now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. and a fine play. but not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
armed robber.
yeah, right.
so, why did you bring this along?
harvard. the harvard business school.
he had help.  from our side, sir.
she's crazy.  you should have killed her.
i want you to stay and find wynant.
what happened to gibarian?
i understand.
who knows what you're gonna do in there? i don't want you -
alright!
there's something i've been meaning to tell you, heather.
the reason i called is -- i won't be home for dinner tonight. the branch manager from kansas city is in town -- i'm taking him to the theatre music man, what else? no, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  tell me something,  baxter  -- have you seen music man?
the old indian burial ground.
i brought you a special present.
welcome to venice. this place reeks, doesn't it? can you smell it? ugh. sorry. not the best way to spend your first day.
something like that
i can't get power, sir!
yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  we've got pizza.
we think he's had a change of heart.  so we should be celebrating.
up there they wouldn't be a problem.
oh, no.
uh, well, that's okay - i don't dance, heh, heh...
vhy do you persecute me?  my papers are in order.  i love my country.  "oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber vaves of grain."
the banks are out of luck, eh?
he's blind, for chri...
why would i give a shit how you feel. and i got news for you. i loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... i'm toying with the idea of killing david ravell off in a boating accident.
receipts and bills and... everything's here.
i told my dad before he died, i'd take care of mom. and i'll do it.  this guy wants to kill you?
what reactor?!
whatever it is, the answer's no, eddie.  i'm too busy tonight.
that's a great philosophy.
reach for the sky!!
must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
that's right mike. but he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, he's in woodstock now.
...not now, brian.
what kind of activity?
marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
anything else you --
daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet.
what on earth is goin' on here! what's got into you, delmar!
stop. right there.
hey, sull.  my cable's out again.
i watched tv.
the wire's showing!
they don't come better. but i don't deny there are times i wonder about things i won't have. maybe one day i'll get to see egypt. maybe not. but i know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
oh yes.  we have to agree what's real and what's not. that's what holds us together.
ten is hardly worth the effort. we're talking a lousy million five u.s.
hey, pony, this is my friend bee-bee.
no. those two were together before kenny and i started hanging out and that's over, what, god a year now.
not really.
if you get injured, you get nothing.
what's he doing?
no, i don't want you going on the street.
you took an awful big risk back there.
well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  i can't do unauthorized work. i suppose i can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  then you get in an accident and get killed.  or worse.  who they gonna blame then?  they gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
three days. are you hungry?
the moron?
kim?
can i be excused?  i'm not hungry.
you like to work alone. i've heard that about you.
cobb, jones, i want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  bowman and sixpack...living quarters...
get out of here....
the stone age.
driving in circles, waiting for-
